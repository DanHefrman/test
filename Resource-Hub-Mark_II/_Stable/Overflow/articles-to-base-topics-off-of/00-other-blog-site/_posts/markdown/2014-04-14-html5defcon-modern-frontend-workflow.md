This weekend I atteneded Kerala's first [HTML5 devloper conference](http://html5conf.in) ([#html5defcon](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23html5defcon)) held at XIME. It was an absolutely wonderful experience to be there as an speaker as well as an attendee. This was my first official conference talk. Before this, I had only some experience in giving talks in meetups.

Here I talked about "Modern Frontend Workflow" with [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io). Since this was the first talk I given infront of more than 25 people, I was really tensed and it lead to missing out giving a demo (even though I am totaly prepared for it).

If you missed it, please find below the slides of my talk.

I would like to thank the whole organisers for organising such a beautiful event and giving opportunity for me to give a talk and also Rahul Ramesh([@theCoderDotIn](https://twitter.com/theCoderDotIn)) for push me and said "you can do it" when I told him I am not ready to give a talk in a conference.
