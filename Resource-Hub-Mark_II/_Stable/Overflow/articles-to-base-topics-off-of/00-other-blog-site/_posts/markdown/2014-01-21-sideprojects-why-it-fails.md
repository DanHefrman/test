Here is my slides on my talk at [Kerala Ruby User Group meetup](http://krug.github.io/posts/jan-2014-meetup/) on 2014 January 19 at Mobme Wireless.

# Summary

In this talk, I tried to summarize the issues I faced while working on side projects and which eventually lead to fail of that project. Repeated failure make me think that there was something wrong with me, and tried to figure it out.

So here is the curated list of mistakes, I beleive I done while working on sideproject which caused the failure. Also I tried to list out prossible solutions of the issues.
