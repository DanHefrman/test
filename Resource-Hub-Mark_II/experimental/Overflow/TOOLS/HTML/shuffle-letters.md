This tool rearranges all letters in the given string, text, or sentence. It uses Fisher-Yates-Knuth shuffling algorithm to do the job. This algorithm generates random permutations of finite sets of characters with the same probability distribution. For a string of n letters, there are 1Ã—2Ã—3Ã—â€¦Ã—(n-1)Ã—n (n factorial) possible unique letter permutations. The Fisher and Yates' method rearranges each letter individually but you can also move more than one letter at a time. With the letter grouping option, you can combine several letters into a group and move them as a whole unit. For example, if the input text is "orange" and you enter a group size of 2, then you'll get three double-letter units: "or", "an", "ge". For these units, there are 6 (1Ã—2Ã—3 = 3 factorial) possible permutations and they are: "or-an-ge", "or-ge-an", "an-or-ge", "an-ge-or", "ge-an-or", "ge-or-an". You can also use the "Get Unique Letters" option, which removes repeated letters and performs the shuffling of only unique characters. And with the "Get Clean Letters" option, you can remove unneeded punctuation marks by listing them in the cleanup list. Quick and simple!

Mix Letters in Long Word

This example shuffles all letters in a long word. The word has 14 letters, so there are as many as 14 factorial (87,178,291,200) unique symbol permutations.

Syllable Shuffling

In this example, we syllabify the word "aurora" and get three groups of two letters in length: "au", "ro", "ra". We intermix the syllables, keeping the letter order in the syllables fixed. For this word, 6 unique permutations of syllables are possible: "au-ro-ra", "au-ra-ro", "ro-au-ra", "ro-ra-au", "ra-au-ro", "ra-ro-au", each with an equal uniform probability of 1/6 (16.6%).

Unique Letter Permutation

In this example, we use all additional shuffle options to get an interesting mix of letters and emojis. We activate the "Get Clean Letters" option, which removes all punctuation marks before remixing the letters and enable the "Get Unique Letters" option, which deletes all duplicate letters in the text.
