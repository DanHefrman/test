Random binary file generator
============================

World"s simplest file tool
--------------------------

This is a free browser-based utility that generates random binary files. You can specify the file size in bytes, kilobytes, or megabytes, and choose a predefined range of bytes for the random content, or set your own custom byte range. You can create as many random files as you need and save them with any file extension. Created by computer geeks at team broowserools.

<span class="primary">Random binary file generator tool</span> <span class="secondary">What is a random binary file generator?</span>

This browser-based program creates random binary files of any size. The needed file size can be set in the options. The file size can be configured by entering an integer (such as "32") or a number with the prefix "b" (such as "32b") in the file length field. You can also specify the file length in kilobytes (for example, "8k" or "8kb") and in megabytes (for example, "2m" or "2mb"). There are 1024 bytes in a kilobyte (1kb = 1024b) and 1024 kilobytes in a megabyte (1mb = 1024kb = 1024×1024b). The contents of the file can also be adjusted in the options. To quickly generate files with different content, the app is equipped with a predefined byte range selection list. By choosing one of the predefined byte ranges, the random byte selection algorithms will pick bytes only from the selected range. The first (and default) byte range includes all 8-bit bytes from 0 (0x00) to 255 (0xFF). The other range categories are Low Nibbles (bytes from 0 to 127), which have the lower end set, High Nibbles (bytes 128-255), which have the higher end set, Full Bytes with all bits set (0xFF), Null Bytes with no bits sets (0x00), the C0 ASCII Control Chars (0-31 and 127), C1 Extended ASCII Control Chars (128-159), Printable ASCII Chars (32-126), Lowercase Chars (97-122), Uppercase Chars (65-90), Digits (48-57), Punctuation Chars (33-47, 58-64, 91-96, 123-126), Single Bits (0 and 1), and Powers of Two (bytes 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128). To create your own range of bytes, use the custom range mode, and enter the necessary bytes in the field below. For example, by entering "32-64", the program will generate bytes from 32 to 64 (both inclusive). Similarly, by entering "16, 32-64", the program will generate bytes 16 and 32 to 64. Each randomly generated binary file can be download with any extension that can be specified in the file extension option (by default, the extension is .bin).

Half Octet File

In this example, we generate a random binary file that contains bytes in the range 0 to 127, also known as the Low Nibble range. Bytes in this range have bits set only in the first four lower bits and the higher four bits are always zero. This byte range includes all printable, non-printable, and control characters from the ASCII table. We create 128 random bytes and get a file of size 128 bytes with the .bin extension. This range is also known as the Half Octet range.

Text File of Punctuation

This example creates a text file (.txt extension) with 256 random bytes. The generated bytes are from several different ranges that correspond to all one-byte punctuation marks. The byte values of punctuation characters are: 33 to 47, 58 to 64, 91 to 96, and 123 to 126.

Fibonacci File

In this example, we let the famous Leonardo of Pisa (also known as Fibonacci) play with our utility. Needless to say, he entered a custom byte range that contains only the Fibonacci numbers. As a result, the generated binary file contains the Fibonacci bytes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233. The file size of the Fibonacci file is 64b and of course, its extension is .fib.

All Bits Set

In this example, we create a 512-byte long file that has absolutely all bits set. Bytes with all bits set have the value 255 (0xFF in hex or 11111111 in binary) and the file contains a total of 4096 one-bits (512 x 8). As the file contains all one-bits, we give it an extension .one.

Zero-filled File

This example generates a 2kb all-bits-zero file. What that means is that all bytes in it are zero bytes with all bits unset. In other words, it"s a void file filled with NULs. The extension of this file is .zero.
