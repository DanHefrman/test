With this tool you can replace one part of text with another. First, enter the text pattern you want to replace in search text options, then specify the new content that you want to see in its place in replace text options. This tool is greedy and it will search for all occurrences of the given text fragment and replace them all. For advanced users, we've also added ability to find patterns using a regular expression, which may or may not be greedy, depending on regex options you've provided. Textabulous!

Abbreviate Text

This example finds all places where phrase "personal computer" appears and replaces it with its abbreviation "PC".

A personal computer - computer designed for single user operation. The personal computer has two important advantages compared with all other types of computers: it has a relatively simple operation and can solve a fairly wide class of problems. The personal computer can be a microcomputer, desktop computer, a laptop computer, a tablet personal computer or a handheld personal computer. Thus, the personal computer is a computer that serves to work, access and use network capabilities. This is a platform for gaming and multimedia features.

List of Highest Mountains

In this example, we change an ordered list of the highest mountains in the world to an unordered list. We do this by using a regular expression that finds digits followed by a dot. Once the regex matches, we replace the matched part with a dash, and we repeat it globally via /g regex modifier.

1. Mount Everest 2. K2 (Godwin Austen) 3. Kangchenjunga 4. Lhotse 5. Makalu 6. Cho Oyu 7. Dhaulagiri I 8. Manaslu 9. Nanga Parbat

\- Mount Everest - K2 (Godwin Austen) - Kangchenjunga - Lhotse - Makalu - Cho Oyu - Dhaulagiri I - Manaslu - Nanga Parbat

This example hides personal information (phone numbers) in text. It uses a super complicated regexp that matches various ten-digit phone number formats and replaces them with a phrase "(number hidden)".

Please call me ASAP at 212 223 1210. My other phone number is (415) 445 8188. If you can't reach me, use my mom's number 7201990034. Thanks!
