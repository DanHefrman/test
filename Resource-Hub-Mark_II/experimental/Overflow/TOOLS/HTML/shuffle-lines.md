<span class="primary">Text lines shuffler tool</span> <span class="secondary">What is a text lines shuffler?</span>

This tool rearranges the order of lines in the given textual data. It uses the Knuth method to do it, aka the Fisher and Yates order permutation algorithm. The behavior of the algorithm changes based on how many lines are shuffled at the same time. By default, it takes every single line in turn (1, 2, 3, …, n), generates a random number from 1 to n for it, which is the new position, and moves the line to this new place. It can also take several lines at once and move them together without splitting them apart. For example, if you enter the number 2 in the group size option, it will glue the 1st and 2nd lines together and move them together to a new position, then it will take the 3rd and 4th lines together, then the 5th and 6th, and so on. This way, you can shuffle any number of lines and preserve their relative positions. If the "Trim Lines" option is active, the utility removes trailing and leading whitespace in each line before shuffling them. If any of the lines are empty, the program can quickly delete it if the option "Skip Empty Lines" is enabled. Another option that can be useful is "Skip Duplicate Lines". It checks if the current line was already seen in the text before and if so, the application deletes this duplicate. Simple and easy!

List of Superheroes

This example does a random permutation of rows in a list of superheroes. It randomly assigns a new position to each row and removes several empty lines so that there is no extra space in the output.

Skip Duplicate Lines <span class="option-details">Remove lines that appear more than once.</span>

Malala Yousafzai Quote

In this example, we split six lines of a Malala Yousafzai quote into three groups (two lines per group) and shuffle them. Each pair of lines, namely the 1st and 2nd, the 3rd and 4th, and the 5th and 6th remain glued together even after shuffling. We also activate the "Trim Lines" option to get rid of whitespace on the right and left sides of the text on each line.

Visual Arts Styles

This example takes a sequence of drawing styles as input. Unfortunately, there are several repeated lines in the input that we'd like to delete. In order to shuffle the styles and also erase extra copies, we have enabled the "Skip Duplicate Lines" option.
