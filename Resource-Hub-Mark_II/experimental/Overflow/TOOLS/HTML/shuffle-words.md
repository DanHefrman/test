<span class="primary">Word shuffler tool</span> <span class="secondary">What is a word shuffler?</span>

This tool rearranges the order of words in the provided text, sentence, or string. The shuffling is performed by Fisher-Yates's algorithm, also known as Knuth's shuffle algorithm. You can also specify the symbol that separates the input words and also change the symbol that separates the shuffled words in the output. By default, the space character is used to split the input data into words and it's used after every word in the mixed output. You can configure the split character in the options. For example, you can enter "-" to separate words by a dash and enter "\\n" to output permuted words in a vertical column. You can also shuffle individual letters if you erase the input delimiter and set it to the empty string. The words can be grouped into tuples of two, three, or more words and shuffled as groups. In this case, words within a group remain stable and the entire tuple moves to a random position. You can also get rid of duplicates in a mixed sequence and display only one copy of each word (or tuple). If your text contains unnecessary punctuation marks, such as quotes, full stops, and question marks, then you can quickly remove them. We have already populated the punctuation remover option with the most commonly used punctuation characters, but if you need to delete any other ones, just add them at the end of the option.

Shuffle Words

This example shuffles 6 words separated by a space. Each word is assigned a random position when clicking on the example.

Remove Punctuation <span class="option-details">Shuffle words without punctuation marks.</span>

Shuffle Letters

This example shuffles all letters of the given word. This is accomplished by clearing both the input and output separator fields (setting them to the empty string).

Input Delimiter <span class="option-details">Split the input data by this sequence of characters. (Leave empty to shuffle letters.)</span>

Remove Punctuation <span class="option-details">Shuffle words without punctuation marks.</span>

Multiline Output

In this example, we rearrange a text quote by William Shakespeare. We set the output delimiter to a newline "\\n", which puts every word on a new line in the output. We also remove all unwanted punctuation marks to get clean words in the output.

"There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so."

it but bad is so There thinking or nothing good either makes

Remove Punctuation <span class="option-details">Shuffle words without punctuation marks.</span>

Punctuation Chars <span class="option-details">Enter the list of punctuation marks to remove.</span>

Randomize Word Pairs

In this example, we combine the input words in pairs and randomize the pair order. The phrases "one life", "one love", and "one chance" randomly change positions but the individual words in each phrase always stick together. We also remove the comma and dot characters via the "Remove Punctuation" option.

one life, one love, one chance.

one love one chance one life

Three-word Groups

This example loads multiple three-word sentences in the input and rearranges their positions. As every sentence contains exactly three words, the group size is set to three. If you look closely, some of the sentences are repeated and to delete the duplicate sentences, we have activated the "Remove Repeated Words" option. This way, only the unique groups of three words are printed.

keep it simple. keep it honest. keep it simple. keep it real. keep it honest.

keep it real. keep it simple. keep it honest.
