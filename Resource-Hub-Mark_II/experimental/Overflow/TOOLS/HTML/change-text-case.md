With this tool, you can quickly switch between ten different text capitalization modes. The "Lower Case" mode converts all characters in the input text into small case glyphs. The "Upper Case" mode, on the contrary, makes all glyphs capital case. The "Random Case" mode flips a coin for each letter and randomly selects a large or small glyph. The "Title Case" option allows you to easily create the correct capitalization for text headings. It makes all words start with the capital letter, except minor words, such as "an", "of", and "to", that it leaves in lowercase. The "Sentence Case" is very useful for fixing the case in large texts. It splits the text into sentences, then turns the first letter into uppercase and all other chars into lowercase. It also capitalizes the pronoun "I" and contractions, such as "I"m", "I"ll", and "I"ve". The cases "Alternating-1" and "Alternating-2" create a wavy text by switching between the upper and lower case letters. The "Alternating-1" mode starts the wavy capitalization from the uppercase, the "Alternating-2" starts from the lowercase. The option "Inverse Case" processes the case of the input text and returns its opposite case – the lowercase letters get swapped with uppercase letters and the uppercase with lowercase. The "Capitalized Case" mode makes the first letter of each word uppercase and the rest are made lowercase. Finally, the "Reverse Capitalized Case" mode makes the last letter of each word uppercase and the rest are made lowercase. Textabulous!
