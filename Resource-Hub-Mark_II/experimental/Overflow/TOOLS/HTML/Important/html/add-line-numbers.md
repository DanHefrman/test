<span class="primary">Text line number adder tool</span> <span class="secondary">What is a text line number adder?</span>

With this online application, you can add line numbering to the text. The program splits the text input into individual lines and each line gets an incremental number added to its start. By default, it counts all lines, but you can also choose a mode that skips empty lines, which includes lines with only whitespaces. You can also adjust the numbering format. We placed the three most popular ordered list formats in the quick use list, but if you want to create a different format, then select the “custom” mode and enter the desired pattern in the field below. The special variable “%n” will be replaced with the current line number. For example, “(%n)” will be replaced with “(1)”, “(2)”, “(3)”, etc. Textabulous!

Somewhere Over the Rainbow

In this example, we add line numbers to “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” lyrics by Israel Kamakawiwo\`ole. We use ordinal numbers for the line format and count all the lines in the input, including empty ones that separate the verses.

Somewhere over the rainbow Way up high And the dreams that you dream of Once in a lullaby Somewhere over the rainbow Bluebirds fly And the dreams that you dream of Dreams really do come true

1.  Somewhere over the rainbow 2. Way up high 3. And the dreams that you dream of 4. Once in a lullaby 5. 6. Somewhere over the rainbow 7. Bluebirds fly 8. And the dreams that you dream of 9. Dreams really do come true

Poem “Dreams”

In this example, we enumerate lines in the poem “Dreams” by Langston Hughes. We have activated the “Number Non-empty Lines” mode, therefore empty lines are skipped and only lines with visual characters in them get numbers. We have also set the numbering format to be the line number followed by a round bracket. In the output, we get nine numbered lines of the poem.

List of Sports

In this example, we decided to create our own line numbers for a list of different sports names. To do this, we selected the “custom” option in the list of formats and entered the pattern “\[%n\]” in the field below. Here “%n” corresponds to the line numbers. As a result, all numbers are enclosed in square brackets.
