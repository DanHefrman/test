With this tool, you can truncate text to any length. You can specify how many characters to keep in the output and which side of the text to crop. You can also truncate multiple sentences at once by enabling the line-by-line function. Additionally, you can specify the truncation indicator characters, such as three dots that get appended as a suffix, if the truncation is done on the right side, or as an affix, if the truncation is done on the left side. Textabulous!

Truncate Code Quote

This example cuts a quote by Charles Petzold, leaving only the first 120 letters.

Code is not like other how-computers-work books. It doesn't have big color illustrations of disk drives with arrows showing how the data sweeps into the computer. Code has no drawings of trains carrying a cargo of zeros and ones. Metaphors and similes are wonderful literary devices but they do nothing but obscure the beauty of technology.
