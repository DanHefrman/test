<p>Github revolutionized how we contribute to Open Source. All my past contribution was through Github pull requests. As a break from that recently I got a opportunity to contribute a minor patch to <a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-android/">wireguard-android</a> which is outside of github ecosystem.</p>
<p>Since <code>wireguard</code> follows linux way of accepting patches via <strong>email</strong> I have to setup the <code>git send-email</code> command to send my patch. This post is about my learning on setting up git and use my Gmail to send the patch.</p>
<p>This post is based on <code>Ubuntu</code> and expect you already have git installed setup on your machine</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>We will get started with installing the required package from <code>apt-get</code>. <code>git-email</code> is the package we required to send the patch via email. We can install this by running the command below.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install git-email</code></pre>
<p>Once the installation is success we can configure the <code>sendmail</code> smtp configuration.</p>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>Add the following to your global/local git config as per your need. Since I am planning to use this only for wireguard repo I added these into local config.</p>
<pre><code>#.git/config
[sendemail]
    smtpserver = smtp.googlemail.com
    smtpencryption = tls
    smtpserverport = 587
    smtpuser = youremail@gmail.com</code></pre>
<p>Please remember to replace <code>youremail@gmail.com</code> with your original email which you indent to use. That email should have post access to the email group to which we are sending the patch to.</p>
<p>Also remember not to use <code>alias</code> email if you are using gmail co-orporate account.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-application-password-on-gmail">Create a application password on gmail</h2>
<p>In Gmail instead of using your main password, you can generate different passwords for different application. Goto <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords">app passwords</a> in your google account and generate the new password for <code>git-email</code> and keep it handy. I recommend using a password managers since you need this password everytime you need to send the patch.</p>
<h2 id="create-the-patch">Create the patch</h2>
<p>Next let’s generate the patch files for all the commits which we need to send.</p>
<pre><code>git format-patch --to=to@list.email.com HEAD~..HEAD</code></pre>
<p>The above command will generate patch only for the latest commit. if you have to send patches of last 2 commits instead of <code>HEAD~..HEAD</code> use <code>HEAD~2..HEAD</code>.</p>
<p>This will create <code>.patch</code> file in the current directory. Please remember to update the <code>--to</code> with actual email address.</p>
<h2 id="send-patch-as-email">Send patch as email</h2>
<p>Once we have the <code>.patch</code> files we can initiate send.</p>
<pre><code>git send-email *.patch</code></pre>
<p>This command will initial the send and will ask for the <code>to</code> email and <code>cc</code> emails before the gmail password prompt.</p>

<pre><code>Please make sure to provide only the app password we generated a while ago.</code></pre>
<p>Once the correct password is entered we will get the success message.</p>
