Here is my slides on my talk at [KeralaJS meetup](http://keralajs.org/) on 2014 January 26 at [Hacker Space](http://hackerspace.aisat.ac.in/).

Summary
=======

With this talk, my primary intention was to share **How to setup node.js for development** so that user can install modules without using `sudo` privilege. For yeoman actually we recieve alot of issue, since users try to use it with `sudo` privilege. As a team we believe installing npm modules with sudo privilege is bad.

In addition, I tried to introduce some tools to debug a node.js application as well as how to start creating node module with `npm init`.
