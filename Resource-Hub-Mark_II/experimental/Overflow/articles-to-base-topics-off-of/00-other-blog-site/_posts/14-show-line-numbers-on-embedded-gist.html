<p>    So its almost a month from my last <a href="http://blog.revathskumar.com/2012/08/embed-files-from-github-repository-into-webpage.html">blog post</a>. I am back here with another small tip to <strong>show line numbers on the gists</strong> embedded on you web page. I use gists to embed all the codes on blogs, recently I thought it will be really helpful if the gist show line number, so that I can refer to line number in my blog while I explains it. So as usual after some googling I found this hack.</p>
<p>    You can easily show the line numbers on gists by adding some simple css to your page. Here is the css below</p>
<p>    Adding the above css to the webpage will enable line numbers to all your gists on your webpage.</p>
<p>Hope you find it helpful.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
