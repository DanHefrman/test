<p>I am sure that you here because, you have a situation that you need to embed a file from a github repository to your webpage/blog. right?</p>
<p>I was in the same situation once, so I googled and got a perfect solution for my need and now for yours.</p>
<h3 id="gist-it">Gist-it</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://gist-it.appspot.com/">Gist-it</a></strong> is your solution for it. A man named “<a href="http://github.com/robertkrimen"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Robert Krimen</span></a>” is kind enough to create a application so that we can embed any file from github repository to our webpage/blog. You can do it as simple as in three steps, just like you embed a gist, hoping you are familiar with embedding gist. </p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Copy github url of the file you like to embed.</li>
<li>Submit it to Gist-it and copy the script tag generated.</li>
<li>Use the script tag copied in you blog, same as you use gist.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="a-sample-file-is-embedded-here.">A sample file is embedded here.</h3>
<p>Github url of file : <a href="https://github.com/revathskumar/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/aliases.zsh" class="uri">https://github.com/revathskumar/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/aliases.zsh</a></p>
<p>If you like to contribute to this project here is the <a href="https://github.com/robertkrimen/gist-it">source code in github</a>.<br />
Hope you got it. Now start embedding it.</p>
