If your development machine, hangs due to CPU usage of elastic search, here are the two settings which you need to update. I tested these settings and got real perfomance gain on my **Ubuntu** development machine.

**The settings below should be used only on `development` machines.**

1. Set HEAP size
================

My default the ElasticSearch heap size is 256m minimum and 1g maximum. You need to update the maximum size to 256m. To do this open `/etc/init.d/elasticsearch` and uncomment the line,

    ES_HEAP_SIZE=256m

2. Set number of shards & replicas
==================================

By default the number of shards is set to 5 and replicas to 1. We can update to shards as 1 and replicas as 0 in development, which will lead to real gain of perfomance.

    # /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
    index.number_of_shards: 1
    index.number_of_replicas: 0

Thanks.
