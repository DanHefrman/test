When I work with `$.ajax`, many times I came across situations where I need to set the success callback conditionally. I am not pretty intrested in setting a common callback and check the condition inside it. I like my functions to be simple and do less things as possible. So I used to set the options object explicity and set the `options['success']` conditionally and pass the resultant option object to `$.ajax` method.

    options = {
      url: "create",
      data: JSON.stringify(data),
      contentType: 'application/json',
      type: "POST",
      error: handleFail,
    }

    if(type == "online") {
      options['success'] = function(response, status, xhr) {
        // ...
      }
    }
    else if(type == "other") {
      options['success'] = function(response, status, xhr) {
        // ...
      }
    }

    $.ajax(options)

But, ever since I am introduced to promises, I use the promise way to accomblish things. no more setting of options object conditionally. Since the `$.ajax` method will return a promise, use the returned object to chain with `$.done` method and set them conditionally with the callbacks. For me this is much more cleaner and extendable than the previous method and its the starting point where I am moving to promises where ever possible.

    $ajOrder = $.ajax({
      url: "create",
      data: JSON.stringify(data),
      contentType: 'application/json',
      type: "POST",
      error: handleFail
    });

    if( type == "online" ) {
      $ajOrder.done( function(response,status,xhr) {
        // ...
      });
    }
    else if( type == "other" ) {
      $ajOrder.done( function(response,status,xhr){
        //...
      });
    }

I have already discussed the [promises in JavaScript](/2013/12/promises-in-javascript.html) a year back in [KeralaJS](http://keralajs.org) meetup. Hope that slides help you to get started with promises.

If you know any method better than these, please let me know. I am looking forward for the feedbacks.
