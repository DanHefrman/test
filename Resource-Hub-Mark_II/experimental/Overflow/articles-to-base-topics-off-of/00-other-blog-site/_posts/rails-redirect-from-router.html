<p>In one of my recent requirements, I need redirect the people/bot landing on an old/deprecated urls need to redirected to either a new page or to our home page. Usually I do such redirecting from the controller, But recently I came to know that we can even redirect from the router itself.</p>
<h2 id="simple-redirect">Simple redirect</h2>
<pre><code>match /.*/, to:  redirect(&#39;/&#39;), via: :all</code></pre>
<p>The above route will match anything and route to homepage. Be cautions to use such routes, and use only in end of your <code>WhatznearWebApp::Application.routes.draw</code> block in router file. The routes on top of <code>draw</code> block have higher precedence and matched first.</p>
<h2 id="redirect-with-constraints">Redirect with constraints</h2>
<p>If you have some constraints for redirects you can use <code>:constaints</code> key to impose them.</p>
<pre><code>match &quot;:url&quot;, to: redirect(&#39;/&#39;), via: :all, constraints: { url: /stores-.*/ }</code></pre>
<p>In the above route, the request will be redirected to homepage only if the url starts with <code>stores-</code>. Make sure you don’t use <code>^</code>(Regexp anchor characters) to specify <code>starts with</code> rails won’t accept that.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-am-redirecting">Why I am redirecting</h2>
<p>If you are thinking of asking me why I am redirecting instead of mapping this to home page, the reasons are</p>
<ul>
<li>since the urls are deprecated, I don’t want anyone to bookmark this.</li>
<li>search engine crawlers should know that this url is redirect and should not index as home page.</li>
</ul>
