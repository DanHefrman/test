<p>When <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3697-server-generated-javascript-responses">SJR</a>(Server-generated JavaScript Responses) was first introduced to me by <span class="citation" data-cites="sunilkumar_g56">[<span class="citation" data-cites="sunilkumar"><span class="citation" data-cites="sunilkumar">@sunilkumar</span></span>_g56]</span>(https://twitter.com/sunilkumar_g56), I was not much impressed until I actually use it my project. Yes, they are really handy and helps you to work done really faster. But one thing I hate about is writing a part of JavaScript in the rails views as <code>.js.erb</code>.</p>
<p>I found it bit difficult to read the code using SJR because while I read the ajax action in some JS file and then I need to go into some other file to know what happens when it is success/failure. Also if you are use Constructor pattern for your components, its difficult to access even the public methods in SJR. So I like to return the response of the ajax request and do the DOM manipulation on success and failure in module itself.</p>
<p>If the ajax response is just some HTML and you need to make change only in one location on DOM, you just need to render the partial/view, but when you have multiple data to return as ajax response and need to make DOM changes in multiple areas we need to return the response as JSON.</p>
<p>You might now think that what so difficult to do it? Me too thought the same until I need to return a rendered HTML as the value in JSON. The <code>jQuery.ajax</code> function started throwing error saying <code>parseerror</code> to the returned json.</p>
<p>To fix this you need to run to_json on the rendered HTML,</p>
<p>{% highlight erb %} { “status”: “success”, “html”: { “products”: &lt;%= (render partial: ‘show.html’).to_json.html_safe %&gt; }, “data”: { “count”: &lt;%= <span class="citation" data-cites="products"><span class="citation" data-cites="products"><span class="citation" data-cites="products">@products</span></span> [“search_count”]</span> %&gt; } } {% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>So you might be wondering whether the <code>String</code> class have a method named <code>to_json</code>, No, but <code>render</code> method really returns <code>EscapedString</code> which have a <code>to_json</code> method on it. You can see the source in <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/08754f12e65a9ec79633a605e986d0f1ffa4b251/activesupport/lib/active_support/json/encoding.rb#L54-L60">activesupport/lib/active_support/json/encoding.rb</a></p>
<p>This <code>to_json</code> method will escape &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; to unicode chars.</p>
