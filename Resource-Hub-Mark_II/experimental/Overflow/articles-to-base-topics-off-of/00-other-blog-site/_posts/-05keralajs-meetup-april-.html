<p>Last saturday(2014-04-26), we had our 5th <a href="http://keralajs.org/2014/04/23/keralajs-meetup-april-2014">KeralaJS</a> meetup at <a href="http://toobler.com/">Toobler</a>. We started our meetup with introduction to KeralaJS for our new members. Then moved to live coding session by <a href="https://twitter.com/42races">Deepak Kumar</a> on “Introduction to <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>”. The session continued till 4, explaining how to get started with Ember and various features of it.</p>
<p>After the coding session, we went for a networking break for 20 minutes and back for my talk on <a href="https://github.com/petermichaux/maria">Maria.js</a>. I started it with explaing classic MVC and why JavaScript frameworks are not actual MVC (Classic). I explained how Model 2 pattern got confused with MVC and ignited a discussion on MVC and patterns.</p>
<p>Our last talk was by <a href="http://praseedp.blogspot.in/">Praseed Pai</a> and he about the JavaScript port of his compiler, “<a href="http://slangfordotnet.codeplex.com/">Slang</a>”. He also showed us running it on Google chrome. He actually inspired us to write a compiler by saying “Writing a compiler now a days are really easy”.</p>
<p>After that we wind up our 5th meetup by listing our plans for next meetup. Before I finish I would like to thank Toobler again for hosting us a wonderful meetup.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
