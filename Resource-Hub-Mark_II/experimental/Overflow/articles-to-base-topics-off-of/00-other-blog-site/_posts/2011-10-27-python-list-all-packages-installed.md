If you have some background on ruby then surely, you have been used gem list to get the list of installed modules. In this blog post we will see how to list all the modules installed in python. There are two ways you can get the list of installed packages on python.

1.  **Using help function** You can use help function in python to get the list of modules installed. Get into python prompt and type the following command. This will list all the modules installed in the system.You donâ€™t need to install any additional package for listing it, but you need to manually search or filter the required module from the list.

2.  **using python-pip** Even though you need to install additional package for using this, you can easily search or filter the result with grep command. Eg : **pip freeze | grep feed**

You can use any of this method which you think it is convenient for you. Thanks
