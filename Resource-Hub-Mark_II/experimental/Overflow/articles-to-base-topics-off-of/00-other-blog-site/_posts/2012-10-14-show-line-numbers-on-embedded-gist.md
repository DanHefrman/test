    So its almost a month from my last [blog post](http://blog.revathskumar.com/2012/08/embed-files-from-github-repository-into-webpage.html). I am back here with another small tip to **show line numbers on the gists** embedded on you web page. I use gists to embed all the codes on blogs, recently I thought it will be really helpful if the gist show line number, so that I can refer to line number in my blog while I explains it. So as usual after some googling I found this hack.

  

    You can easily show the line numbers on gists by adding some simple css to your page. Here is the css below

  

  

    Adding the above css to the webpage will enable line numbers to all your gists on your webpage.

Hope you find it helpful.

  

Thank you.
