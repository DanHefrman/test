Here is the two simple ways to merge dictionaries in python.  
  

1.  **Using [update](http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#dict.update) method**  
    By using this method the second dictionary(*new\_adm*) will be merged to the first one(*default*) and the update method will return **None**.  
      
2.  **Using [dict](http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#dict)Â constructor**  
    By using this method both first dictionary and second will be merged and stored in a third dictionary(resultant) and *default* and *new\_adm* will remain unchanged.
