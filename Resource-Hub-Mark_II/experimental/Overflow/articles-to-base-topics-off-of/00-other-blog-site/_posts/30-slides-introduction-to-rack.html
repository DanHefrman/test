<p>In our last <a href="http://krug.github.io/">Kerala Ruby</a> meetup I took a session on Intro to Rack. From the beginning of my journey on Rails, I always thought of learning <strong>how rails works</strong>, but didnâ€™t get enough time.</p>
<p>For a long time I was hearing that Rails and most Ruby web frameworks are build on top of <strong>Rack</strong>. Those times I thought rails was full of magic, but the moment I started learning <strong>Rack : The modular web interface for ruby</strong> I came to know that actually the magic happens at Rack level and Rails just add some colors to it with the help of various middle wares.</p>
<p>For me, I have another reason why I started learning Rack. Recently I started learning <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> the most popular web framework for <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> which build based on Rack architecture. Now I have double benefit on investing time in learning Rack architecture and how its middle ware stack works.</p>
