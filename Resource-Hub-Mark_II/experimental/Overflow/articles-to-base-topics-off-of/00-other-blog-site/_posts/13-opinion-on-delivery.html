<p>To ship something, we should first know <code>what to ship</code> and why are we shipping this.</p>
<p>Even though we don’t know the answer to <code>why?</code>, answer to <strong>What?</strong> is a must.<br />
Consider, we don’t know the answer to <strong>What?</strong>. Its like a journey we take without knowing destination. People we meet in the journey will give different suggestions and we take those. We travel a lot, put lot of effort and money into it but no use because we don’t know where we are going.</p>
<p>Same happens in shipping a software or a module of it. Since we haven’t frozen the design or the requirements we tend to keep changing things.</p>
<p><strong>Program Manager</strong> will come with one.<br />
<strong>Business Analyst</strong> with another opinion.<br />
Later the <strong>Engineering Manager</strong> with the third one.</p>
<p>By the end of the sprint, at the time of demo. the question will come</p>
<p><strong>Is that what we worked for the whole sprint?</strong></p>
<p>Nobody want to think about the changes happened to the requirements or to the design.</p>
<p>The problem is clarity on what to deliver and not the efficiency of the developer.</p>
