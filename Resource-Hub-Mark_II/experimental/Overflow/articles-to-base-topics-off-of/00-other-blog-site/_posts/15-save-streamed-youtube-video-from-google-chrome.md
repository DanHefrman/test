    Do you really wanna a script to save the streamed youtube video? Here is it, but there are some conditions. You should stream the video once in your google chrome without buffering. I tried this script  on my U**buntu with Google chrome** and I find it successful. I prefer not to play the video while it streams, because we can’t save a video which shown buffering or loading while we playing it.

   Save the script below as a shell script. Please create a folder named flvs in your **~/Videos/** directory or change the path of **OUTPUTDIR** to some existing directory.

You can execute this script by copy paste this to your terminal and press enter.

    If you are using firefox as browser, I am not sure this script will work even after changing the **CACHE** directory. I haven’t tested this script with firefox or any other Linux distributions. Please feel free to test this on other environments and lemme know whether it works for you. I am awaiting for your response on comments.

  So before I conclude, please keep in mind 

-   stream your video without buffering
-   create or update path of OUTPUTDIR
-   make sure you are on Ubuntu with Google chrome
-   make sure the path to CACHE is correct

Thank you
