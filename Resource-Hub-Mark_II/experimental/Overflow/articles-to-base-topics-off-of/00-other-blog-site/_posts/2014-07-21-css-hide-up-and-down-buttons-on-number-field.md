While working on the responsive version of [whatznear](http://whatznear.com), we wanted to use `<input type="number">` for the pincode so that mobile can show the appropriate the keyboard. But when we use number type in desktop it will show a up/down buttons. The up/down spins for a pincode input is doesnâ€™t look appropriate.

Here is how you can hide those up/down spins with CSS.
------------------------------------------------------

![Input spin](http://i653.photobucket.com/albums/uu253/revathskumar/Coderepo/2014/07/5ffea443-1a5f-424c-9650-407158a048be_zpsa4806bc6.png)

    input[type="number"] {
      -moz-appearance: textfield;
    }

    input::-webkit-outer-spin-button,
    input::-webkit-inner-spin-button {
      /* display: none; <- Crashes Chrome on hover */
      -webkit-appearance: none;
      margin: 0; /* <-- Apparently some margin are still there even though it's hidden */
    }

This will ensure that appropriate keyboard will be show in mobile and input element looks similar to textbox on desktop.
