<p>    Do you really wanna a script to save the streamed youtube video? Here is it, but there are some conditions. You should stream the video once in your google chrome without buffering. I tried this script  on my U<strong>buntu with Google chrome</strong> and I find it successful. I prefer not to play the video while it streams, because we can’t save a video which shown buffering or loading while we playing it.</p>
<p>   Save the script below as a shell script. Please create a folder named flvs in your <strong>~/Videos/</strong> directory or change the path of <strong>OUTPUTDIR</strong> to some existing directory.</p>
<p>You can execute this script by copy paste this to your terminal and press enter.</p>
<p>    If you are using firefox as browser, I am not sure this script will work even after changing the <strong>CACHE</strong> directory. I haven’t tested this script with firefox or any other Linux distributions. Please feel free to test this on other environments and lemme know whether it works for you. I am awaiting for your response on comments.</p>
<p>  So before I conclude, please keep in mind </p>
<ul>
<li>stream your video without buffering</li>
<li>create or update path of OUTPUTDIR</li>
<li>make sure you are on Ubuntu with Google chrome</li>
<li>make sure the path to CACHE is correct</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you</p>
