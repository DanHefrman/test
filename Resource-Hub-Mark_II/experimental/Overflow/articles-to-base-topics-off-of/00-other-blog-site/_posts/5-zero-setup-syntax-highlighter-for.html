<p>          It was two days back I used gist for the first time. Before that I used <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/">syntax highlighter</a> . It was a nice once but setting up this was a nightmare.So googled for the some another syntax highlighter. There I got <a href="http://gist.github.com/">gist</a>. I really amazed with its zero setup feature. From the first try itself i got the desired output.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is the steps I done to show my code in syntax highlighting.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Copied the source code and created new gist.</li>
<li>Copied the embed code from the gist and paste it in content editor right here.yes right here in the content editor (<em>after switching to html</em>) of blogger (where i need to show the source code) itself.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p> Yes, its done. The code is showing in my blog with perfect syntax highlighting. :D.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> Pros</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Zero setup</li>
<li>code is well source controlled and head version is available here.</li>
<li>more languages are supported</li>
<li>Languages are automatically selected.</li>
<li>Better performance.</li>
<li>Source code is centralized. When you need any corrections you just need to update only the gist, all the blogs will be updated.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Showing raw data make the whole web page refresh.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>      The Pros and cons are my own opinions. There is a chance for your opinion to be different ;). I am waiting for it. :D</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Happy blogging.</p>
