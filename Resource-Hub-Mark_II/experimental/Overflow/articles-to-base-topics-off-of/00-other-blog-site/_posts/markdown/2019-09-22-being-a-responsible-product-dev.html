<p>&lt;!–</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways you can be a responsible developer. By responsibility, most devs will think of shipping on time with minimum bugs and compliant with business needs etc.</p>
<p>when devs get blinded with responsibility towards business needs, they <code>forget</code>/<code>forced to forget</code> their responsibility towards users.</p>
<p>Let me try to list down some major issues I have seen when I use different products.</p>
<h2 id="to-protect-the-privacy-of-users">To protect the privacy of users</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make sure not to break the app because third party analytics/chat box is not loaded.</li>
<li>If possible respect the DNT flag and not to load any tracker for those users.</li>
<li>Provide informed consent if any third party is recording the user session.</li>
<li>Don’t deny service to the user because they block some third-party trackers.</li>
<li>Don’t send user identifier info like email/phone etc to the third party services.</li>
<li>If its a blog, providing a text-only version for users who seek privacy</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="to-give-the-better-user-experience">To give the better user experience</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use proper HTML semantics, at minimum use link instead of a button so the user can open in new tab.</li>
<li>Don’t deny the whole service because one of the optional permission is denied by the user.</li>
<li>Try to keep the <code>filter states</code>/<code>page no.</code> on URL, so when the user refreshes the page or navigates and come back, the user won’t lose the context.</li>
<li>Don’t change URL paths without setting a redirect from the old URL to the new one.</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand many of them are not in control of devs. But I believe they can convince their product managers/business analysts to implement those one at a time without hurting business.</p>
