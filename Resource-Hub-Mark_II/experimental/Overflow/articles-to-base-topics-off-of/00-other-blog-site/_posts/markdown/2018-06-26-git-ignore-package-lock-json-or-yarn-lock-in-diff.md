Git diff with `package-lock.json`/`yarn.lock` is difficult since you need to scoll though too much noice, but we canâ€™t git ignore those as well. Those files are suppose to be checked into the repository.

But those can be easily ignored only from the diff.

    git diff -- ':!package-lock.json' ':!yarn.lock'

You can add this to your default alias for `git diff`.

    alias gd="git diff -- ':!package-lock.json' ':!yarn.lock'"

Hope this tip helped.
