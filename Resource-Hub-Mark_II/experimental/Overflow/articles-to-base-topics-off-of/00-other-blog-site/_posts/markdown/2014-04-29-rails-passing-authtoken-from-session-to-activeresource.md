Previously while we need to pass user authtoken with ActiveResource API calls, we were using class variables. But that doesnâ€™t look good as we were running multiple instances of our app. Our previous code look something like

    # app/controllers/application_controller.rb

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base

      before_filter :set_active_resource_header


      private
        def set_active_resource_header
          if current_user
            ActiveResource::Base.auth_token = session[:user].auth_token
          end
        end
    end

and we patched `ActiveResource::Connection#authorization_header` to use our token

    # In ActiveResource::Connection#authorization_header patch
    module ActiveResource

      class Base
        cattr_accessor :token
      end

      class Connection
        def authorization_header(http_method, uri)
          { 'auth_token' => ActiveResource::Base.token }
        end
      end
    end

Recently we figured out there was some issues and thought not to use class variables. Then we need some way to access `session` inside `authorization_header` method. While searching for a solution we came into [request\_store](https://github.com/steveklabnik/request_store) gem.

Request Store
=============

Request store gem helps to store a global state in Rails app in a thread safe way. We can use it like

    def index
      RequestStore.store[:foo] ||= 0
      RequestStore.store[:foo] += 1

      render :text => RequestStore.store[:foo]
    end

Then we updated our code to use request\_store.

    # app/controllers/application_controller.rb

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base

      before_filter :store_user

      private
        def store_user
          RequestStore.store[:user] = session[:user]
        end
    end

    # In ActiveResource::Connection#authorization_header patch
    module ActiveResource

      class Connection
        def authorization_header(http_method, uri)
          if ::RequestStore.store[:user].present?
            { 'auth_token' => ::RequestStore.store[:user].auth_token }
          else
            {}
          end
        end
      end
    end

Now it is working fine, But I would like to know your comments on this.

Thanks.
