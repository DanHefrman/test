<p>Until last wednesday, I was really confused about the functionality of <code>visibility</code>, <code>opacity</code> and <code>display</code> properties. Then <a href="http://twitter.com/shidhin">Shidhin</a> spend some time, explained and make me understand what are the difference between those.</p>
<p>In this post, I am trying to summarize the difference between <code>visibility:hidden</code>, <code>display:none</code> and <code>opacity:0</code>.</p>
<h1 id="demo">Demo</h1>
<p><a href="http://jsbin.com/fupeb/6/embed?output,css" class="jsbin-embed">JS Bin</a></p>
<h1 id="visibility">Visibility</h1>
<p>Using the visibility property in CSS, we can toggle the visibility of an element using the values <code>hidden</code> or <code>visible</code>. If we make the the element hidden, it will be hidden from the user and user can’t access it’s child, but still in the DOM, <code>the space of the element will be consumed</code>.</p>
<p>In the demo above, You can see a box below the text visibility.The box look like a rectangle even the child element is given <code>visibility:hidden</code> proves that it still consumes the space on DOM.</p>
<h1 id="opacity">Opacity</h1>
<p>If we use <code>opacity:0</code> to hide an element, in the fist look it looks like hidden, but still the user <code>can access the child element</code>. It also <code>consume the space</code> of the element in the DOM.</p>
<p>In the above demo, you can try mousehover on the box just below the text opacity. You can see that the curson turns to pointer. Its because there is a link inside that box, which will open <code>google.com</code> in a new tab. Now go ahead and try a click, hooray a new tab opens even though its parent is not visible to our eyes.</p>
<h1 id="display">Display</h1>
<p>If we use <code>display:none</code>, the browser will consider as if the element is not available in the DOM as the result it won’t consume the space.</p>
<p>In the demo above, you can see that the box below the text display is turned into a line and when you try to comment the <code>display:none</code> in the CSS panel it truns back to normal rectangular box.</p>
