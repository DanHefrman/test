In our last [Kerala Ruby](http://krug.github.io/) meetup I took a session on Intro to Rack. From the beginning of my journey on Rails, I always thought of learning **how rails works**, but didn't get enough time.

For a long time I was hearing that Rails and most Ruby web frameworks are build on top of **Rack**. Those times I thought rails was full of magic, but the moment I started learning **Rack : The modular web interface for ruby** I came to know that actually the magic happens at Rack level and Rails just add some colors to it with the help of various middle wares.

For me, I have another reason why I started learning Rack. Recently I started learning [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) the most popular web framework for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) which build based on Rack architecture. Now I have double benefit on investing time in learning Rack architecture and how its middle ware stack works.

My slides are available on [speakerdeck.com](https://speakerdeck.com/revathskumar/rack).
