Last weekend we had our [KeralaJS Novemeber](http://keralajs.org/2014/11/21/keralajs-meetup-november-2014) meetup. There were mainly two talks were listed.

- An Introduction to NoSQL and MongoJS by Nirmal Vyas
- Gulp by myself.

As usual the meetup was awesome, and I like to give brief note about my talk on Gulp.js.
I started the talk with introducing the build, and what all we should preform in this step before deployment.

# Gulp

[Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/), The streaming build system which now getting attraction in the communities. It works based on node streams, which one of the best features of node.js. I introduced the simple api of gulp and how it can be used. The slides of my talk are embeded below.
