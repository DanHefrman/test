Last weekend we had our [KeralaJS Novemeber](http://keralajs.org/2014/11/21/keralajs-meetup-november-2014) meetup. There were mainly two talks were listed.

-   An Introduction to NoSQL and MongoJS by Nirmal Vyas
-   Gulp by myself.

As usual the meetup was awesome, and I like to give brief note about my talk on Gulp.js. I started the talk with introducing the build, and what all we should preform in this step before deployment.
