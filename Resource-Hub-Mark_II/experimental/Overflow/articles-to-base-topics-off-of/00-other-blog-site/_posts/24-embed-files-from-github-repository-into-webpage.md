I am sure that you here because, you have a situation that you need to embed a file from a github repository to your webpage/blog. right?  

  

I was in the same situation once, so I googled and got a perfect solution for my need and now for yours.

  

### Gist-it

**[Gist-it](http://gist-it.appspot.com/)** is your solution for it. A man named "[<span style="font-family: inherit;">Robert Krimen</span>](http://github.com/robertkrimen)" is kind enough to create a application so that we can embed any file from github repository to our webpage/blog. You can do it as simple as in three steps, just like you embed a gist, hoping you are familiar with embedding gist. 

1.  Copy github url of the file you like to embed.
2.  Submit it to Gist-it and copy the script tag generated.
3.  Use the script tag copied in you blog, same as you use gist.

### A sample file is embedded here.

Github url of file : <https://github.com/revathskumar/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/aliases.zsh>

  

  
If you like to contribute to this project here is the [source code in github](https://github.com/robertkrimen/gist-it).  
Hope you got it. Now start embedding it.
