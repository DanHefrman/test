Eventhough I am using CoffeeScript for a couple of months now, many of the feature were still unknown to me. Two days before I got hands into two such features which I wish I have known from the beginning.

Existential Operator
====================

Existential operator will help you to check whether the variable exists or not. It is similar to rubyâ€™s `.nil?` method. consider we have a variable named `open`. we can check whether when open exists using `open?` which returns `true` if the variable is already defined.

    if open?
      console.log "Hello"

This wil be compiled to

    if (typeof open !== "undefined" && open !== null) {
      console.log("Hello");
    }

[Try it yourself](http://coffeescript.org/#try:if%20open%3F%0A%20%20console.log%20%22Hello%22).

This can be used to set the default values/ conditional assinments like

    data = {}
    data.open ?= true

It says, if `data.open` is `null` then set it to `true`. This will be compiled to

    if (data.open == null) {
      data.open = true;
    }

[Try it yourself](http://coffeescript.org/#try:data%20%3D%20%7B%7D%0Aopen%20%3F%3D%20true).

You can read more about exisitential operator below the [operators](http://coffeescript.org/#operators) section.

Multiline comments
==================

Couple of days before only I came to know about the multiline comment with `###` in CoffeeScript. Till that I were using `#`(single line comment).

    ###
     $->
       console.log "Hello"
    ###

$
