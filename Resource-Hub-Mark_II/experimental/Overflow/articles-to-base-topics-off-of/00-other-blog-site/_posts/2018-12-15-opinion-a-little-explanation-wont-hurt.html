<p>In daily standup, I hear</p>
<ul>
<li>Today, I’m working on this api</li>
<li>Today, I’m working on this design</li>
</ul>
<p>this happens for couple of days from the sprint started or sometimes the whole sprint.</p>
<p>Instead lets practice with little bit explanation like</p>
<ul>
<li>I started working with CREATE of this api.</li>
<li>I finished UPDATE of this api and started with DELETE</li>
<li>I had to work on the <strong>unexpected</strong> thing and resumed and continued with DELETE of api.</li>
</ul>
<p>Standup, should be shorter without losing its purpose. <code>I am working on this api</code> kind of update repeatedly defeat its purpose.</p>
<p>A little detail/explanation won’t hurt.</p>
