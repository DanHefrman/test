<h1 id="putty-readme">PuTTY README</h1>
<p>This is the README file for the PuTTY MSI installer distribution. If you’re reading this, you’ve probably just run our installer and installed PuTTY on your system.</p>
<h2 id="what-should-i-do-next">What should I do next?</h2>
<p>If you want to use PuTTY to connect to other computers, or use PSFTP to transfer files, you should just be able to run them from the Start menu.</p>
<p>If you want to use the command-line file transfer utility PSCP, you will need to run this from a Command Prompt or equivalent, because it will not do anything useful without command-line options telling it what files to copy to and from where. You can do this by just running the command ‘pscp’ from a Command Prompt, if you used the installer’s option to put the PuTTY installation directory on your PATH. Alternatively, you can always run pscp.exe by its full pathname, e.g. “C:Files.exe”.</p>
<p>(Note that a Command Prompt that was already open before you ran the installer will not have inherited the update of PATH.)</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-do-if-it-doesnt-work">What do I do if it doesn’t work?</h2>
