The Skills Matrix is a static application that provides engineers the ability to choose technical proficiency for a set of predetermined skills. Results are uniquely hashed in-browser, and managers can visually compare multiple result sets filtered by specific skills.

## Usage

TODO

## Notes

The compact hash computed for each skill set is dependent on a static master list of skills. Any changes to
`skillmatrix.json` invalidates existing hashes.

## Development

```
# npm i           # Install dependencies
# npm run dev     # Visit http://localhost:9999/
# npm run test    # Run unit tests
```

To get help for the commands above or to see all available commands, run `dojo` from the command line.
