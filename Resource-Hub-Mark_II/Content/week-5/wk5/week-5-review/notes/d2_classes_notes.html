<h1 id="intro-to-oop-thinking">INTRO TO OOP THINKING</h1>
<p>OOP overview - approach for breaking down large, complex products into simple solutions - smaller parts can be implemented and tested separately - results in higher confidence in overall solution - makes it easier to pinpoint issues with code</p>
<p>The Big Picture - group data and related actions / behaviors together - treat as single entity within a larger system</p>
<p>Terminology - <code>object</code>: item containing data and behaviors - example: vehicle - <code>properties</code>: pieces of relevant data (kind of like “adjectives”) - example: vehicle model, status of engine (on or off), vehicle color - also called fields or attributes - <code>methods</code>: relevant actions (kind of like “verbs”) - accessor: presents data (properties) - mutator: modifies data - example: start engine</p>
<p>Classes and Constructors - <code>class</code>: definition of an object with properties and methods - “blueprint” for object - framework for properties and methods (data and actions) - similar to how function definition is framework for function - doesnt do anything until it is instantiated (called) - <code>instance</code> : specific object made from a class - object created from “blueprint” defined in class definition - may have certain methods/properties set right away - example: if vehicle class has “color” property, instance of vehicle may have “red” assigned to this property - <code>constructor</code>: special method that handles initial setup of instance - assigns relevant properties - assigns value “red” to “color” property</p>
<p>DRY (don’t repeat yourself) - classes allow us to keep our code dry - may have many instances of our vehicle class in our program - no need to write the same methods over and over again * there should only ever be ONE copy of any important piece of code - if you have more than one copy, may be indication to refactor</p>
<p>OOP Design - balance of resuse, sharing, duplication - more on this to come</p>
<p>Pillars of OOP 1. Encapsulation - the division of responsibility - object is most useful when it hides complex functionality from other parts of code - easier to test and build complex systems when each part of system has its own purpose - example: - an ear doesnt need to know how an eye works - break up roles into separate objects: - ear: listens for sounds - eye: looks for visual signals - face: place eye and ear where they are useful - brain: make sense of sensory signals - objects interact with each other through props/methods w/o needing to know how those actions are handled 2. Abstraction - consideration of how objects are similar - hide implementation details within classes - example: pens and pencils are similar, may be able to group certain properties into parent class 3. Inheritance - classes can pass along properties &amp; methods to other classes - sometimes objects may have many similar properties - indicate that a parent class could be beneficial - example: cats and dogs - cats and dogs share many properties - both have a name, breed, color, owner, etc - both may be able to perform certain tricks - have different properties (dogs bark, cats meow) - makes sense to create an Animal parent class that Dog and Cat can inherit from 4. Polymorphism - one method can have different implementations because the result is equivalent - accomplishing same result in another fashion - example: pens and pencil classes may have “erase” method - for pens, that would require the use of white out - for pencisl, that would require the usee of an erasor - the result is the same</p>
<h1 id="more-oop-explained">MORE OOP EXPLAINED</h1>
<p>Object Oriented Programming - computer programming model - organizes software design around data (or objects) rather than functions</p>
<p>What is an Object? - data field that has unique attributes and behaviors - self contained pieces of code</p>
<p>Classes vs Objects - <code>object class</code>: definition of an object - similar to how function definition defines a function - blueprint for how function behaves - dooesnt do anything until that function is invoked - <code>object instannce</code>: the use of that object</p>
<p>Principles of OOP 1. encapsulation 2. inheritance 3. polymorphism 4. abstraction</p>
<p>Encapsulation - “enclose something in a capsule” - the bundling of data and the methods that act on that data so that access to that data is restricted from outside the bundle - an object stores its state privately and only the object’s methods have access to change it - you dont change the encapsulated state directly - you call a method on the object which may update its state - code that uses thee methods dont have to worry about details</p>
<p>Inheritance - data and methods defined on parent class are avaailable on objects created from classes that inherit from those parent classes - prevents duplication of code<br />
- typically applied to classes</p>
<p>Polymorphism - ability to create a property, func, or object that has more than one realization - ability to substitute classes that havee common functionality in sense of methods and data - “if you can drive a car, you can drive any car”</p>
<pre><code>// polymorphism example 


const rectangle = {
    width: 4,
    height: 6,
    area() {
        return this.width * this.height;
    }
}

const triangle = {
    base: 4,
    height: 2,
    area() {
        return this.base * this.height / 2;
    }
}


const square = {
  side: 1,
  area() {
    return this.side**2;
  }
}


// each object has an area method
// we can use this method regardless of object type

function cumulateShapes(shapes) {

    let totalArea = 0;
    shapes.forEach(shape =&gt; {
        totalArea += shape.area();
    })
    return totalArea;
}</code></pre>
<p>Abstraction - display only essential information - hide the details</p>
<h1 id="basics-of-oop-design">BASICS OF OOP DESIGN</h1>
<p>The problem - design system to track students and teachers accessing an online school - consider how users will get through virtual door (“login”)</p>
<p>Step 1 - Identify Potential classes - think about how we can <code>encapsulate</code> our program - how can we break down our problem into smaller pieces - authentication: how can we check they have the correct username/password - communication: how can we recover lost password - attendance: how can we keep track of students - teacher schedule: how can we keep track of teachers</p>
<p>Step 2 - Specify Properties and methods for each class - <code>Class Account</code>: what properties/methods do accounts need? - possible properties: username, password - possible methods: login, logout, resetPassword - <code>Class Person</code>: what properties/methods do people need? - possible properties: email, mailingAddress, phoneNumber - possible methods: forgotPassword, changeEmail - <code>Class Student</code>: what properties/methods do students need? - possible properties: schedule, attendanceRecord - possible methods: enroll, attend, dropout - <code>Class Teacher</code>: what properties/methods to teachers need? - possible properties: schedule - possible methods: teach</p>
<p>Step 3 - Define relationships - decidee how classes relate to eachother - inheritance: can one class extend another by sharing/adding onto features? - <code>Student</code> and <code>Teacher</code> can likely inherit from <code>Person</code> class - composition: can one class store another class as a property? - each <code>Person</code> will likely have an <code>Account</code> with the school - MANY different possibilities when it comes to OOP design</p>
<h1 id="constructor-functions">CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTIONS</h1>
<p>creating objects using literal notation - all we’ve done up until this point - attributes of “Cat” object representeed by obj literal’s keys</p>
<pre><code>// object literal notation

let dog = {
    name: &#39;Bodhi&#39;,
    bark: () =&gt; {
        console.log(&#39;bark bark&#39;)
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>creating objects using constructor function - “factory” for creating objects of a specific type - calling a constructor function returns new object - props initialized to provided argument values</p>
<pre><code>function Dog (name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}

let dog = new Dog(&#39;bodhi&#39;, 5)</code></pre>
<p>Notice anything weird about this function? 1. name is capitalized to help distinguish func as a constructor 2. function doesn’t explicitely return a value 3. “this” references newly created object inside constructor func</p>
<p>invoking a constructor function with “new” 1. new empty obj is created ({}) 2. new obj prototype is set to obj referenced by constructor funcs prototype prop 3. constructor func is called and “this” is bound to new object 4. new object is returned</p>
<p>invoking a constructor without the <code>new</code> keyword - in strict mode: <code>this</code> will be undefined -&gt; error - in non-strict mode: <code>this</code> will be global object</p>
<pre><code>function Dog (name, age) {
    if (!(this instanceof Dog)) {
        throw new Error (&#39;Dog must be called with new keyword&#39;)
    }
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}</code></pre>
<h1 id="defining-shareable-methods">Defining Shareable Methods</h1>
<p>DONT define methods within constructor func - inefficient in terms of computer memory usage - each instance would have its own method definition - 100 instances = 100 of the same method definitions</p>
<pre><code>// defining shareable methods - the bad way 

function Dog (name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.speak = function() {
        console.log(`bark bark my name is ${this.name}`)
    }
}

let dog = new Dog(&#39;bodhi&#39;, 5);
dog.speak() // bark bark my name is bodhi</code></pre>
<p>Prototype - property of a class constructor - reference to object that contians common attributes/properties across all instances - specifies the object from which object inherits from</p>
<p>DO use prototypes and delegation - a prototype is an object that is delegated to when a reference to an object property or method can’t be resolved - in JS you can make an object the prototype of another object - when an object is a prototype of another object, it’s properties and methods are made available to the other object. - if prop or method isnt available on an obj, JS will look up prototypal chain</p>
<pre><code>// defining shareable methods - the proper way 

function Dog (name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}

Dog.prototype.speak = function() {
    console.log(`bark bark my name is ${this.name}`)
}

let bodhi = new Dog(&#39;bodhi&#39;, 5);
bodhi.speak() // bark bark my name is bodhi</code></pre>
<p>every constructor function has a <code>prototype</code> property - represents object that’ll be used as prototype for instances created by invoking the constructor function with the <code>new</code> keyword - can confirm by comparing prototype for an instance to constructor functions prototype property</p>
<p>summary - every instance created from constructor func has its prototype set to the object referenced by the constructor function’s prototype property - any method we define on constructor functions prototype will be shared across all instances of that object type</p>
<p>when speak() is called: 1. <code>bodhi</code> object is checked to see if method is defined on that object 2. when method isn’t found, method call is delegated to instance’s prototype 3. instance’s prototype is set to <code>Dog</code> constructor funcs <code>prototype</code> property 4. this time, speak() method is found and called - note: can use <code>this</code> to access properties on the instance we’re calling method on (this refers to the instance of dog, fluffy)</p>
<p>problems with arrow functions - don’t have their own “this” binding - they use “this” binding from lexical scope</p>
<p>instanceof operator uses prototypes to determine if obj is an instance of a specific constructor function - checks if prototype of obj on left side of operator is set to prototype property of constructor function on the right side</p>
<h1 id="javascript-classes">JAVASCRIPT CLASSES</h1>
<p>javascript classes - constructor funcs and prototypes mimic class behavior - support for classes added to language in ES2015</p>
<p>ES2015 classes - defines attributes and behavior for object type - used to create instances of that type, just like constructor func - begin with capital letter</p>
<pre><code>class Dog {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    speak() {
        console.log(`bark bark my name is ${this.name}`)
    }
}

let bodhi = new Dog(&#39;bodhi&#39;, 5)
bodhi.speak() // bark bark my name is bodhi</code></pre>
<p>constructor method not required, similar to constructor func 1. don’t explicitly return a value, implicitly returns new obj instance 2. <code>this</code> keyword refrences newly created object instance</p>
<p>when instantiating an instance of class: 1. new empty obj is created 2. new obj prototype is set to class’s <code>prototype</code> property 3. <code>constuctor</code> method is called and <code>this</code> is bound to object 4. new obj is returned</p>
<p>HOISTING - in JS, you can call a function before it’s declared</p>
<h1 id="inheritance">INHERITANCE</h1>
<p>javascript inheritance - classes don’t havee to be defined and used in isolation from one another - possible to base a class - a child class - upon another class - a parent class - child class can inherit properties and methods defined within parent class</p>
<p>benefits of inheritance - gives you a way to share code across classes - prevents code duplication and keeps code DRY</p>
<pre><code>class Animal {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    constructor(name, age) {
        super(name, age)
    }

    speak() {
        console.log(`bark bark my name is ${this.name}`)
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log(`meow meow my name is ${this.name}`)
    }
}

let bodhi = new Dog(&#39;bodhi&#39;, 5)
bodhi.speak() // bark bark my name is bodhi

let pancake = new Cat(&#39;pancake&#39;, 5);
pancake.speak() // meow meow my name is pancake</code></pre>
<p>understanding how <code>this</code> works - <code>this</code> always references the instance object created using <code>new</code>, regardless of where it is used - allows constructor() method to initialize properties eon the instance object</p>
<p>OVERRIDING METHODS IN PARENT CLASS - simply define method in child class with same name</p>
