<li><h5 id="merge-sort-can-be-on-space-complexity">*merge sort can be O(n) space complexity</h5>
<ul>
<li>if we are not creating a new array every time we call merge sort on the left and right side. We can make it O(n) if we keep track of the start and end index of the left/right sides in the original array and pass that into the merge sort calls to the left and right side. In the way we implement, merge sort’s space complexity is O(n log n) because we create a new array to pass into each call of merge sort to the left and right sides.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><h5 id="quick-sorts-complexities-are-a-little-more-complicated">**quick sort’s complexities are a little more complicated</h5>
<ul>
<li>We are generally only concerned with the worst-scenario when we talk Big-O.</li>
<li>With quick sort, the worst case is exceedingly rare (only occurs when our pivot for each round happens to be the next element, resulting in us having to choose n pivot points)</li>
<li>Because it is so rare that this occurs, most people will use consider quick sort to be closer to O(n log n) time complexity.</li>
<li>We also have two space complexities listed. The version that we used in class creates a new array for every call to quicksort, resulting in O(n log n) space. With some tweaking, we can sort in place, modifying the original array and cutting our space complexity to O(log n), which is just a result of the stack frames that we have to create. It’s good to know this method exists, but you will not need to create or identify this version.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li>Apply memoization to recursive problems to make them less than polynomial time.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Main steps for memoizing a problem:
<ol type="1">
<li>Write out the brute force recursion</li>
<li>Add the memo object as an additional argument</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Keys on this object represent input, values are the corresponding output</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Add a base condition that returns the stored value if the argument is already in the memo</li>
<li>Before returning a calculation, store the result in the memo for future use</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Example of a standard and memoized fibonacci:</p>
<p>// Standard Implementation // Time Complexity: O(2^n) // - For each call to fib, we have to make two branches, with n levels to this tree function fib(n) { if (n === 1 || n === 2) return 1; return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2); // fib(3) + fib(2) } //fib(2) + fib(1)</p>
<p>// Using memoization // Time Complexity: O(n) // - We only ever have to calculate fib(x) one time, every other time that we use it in a larger problem, the result is immediately accessible in our memo // - The memo removes the repeated trees of calculations from our original code function fib(n, memo = {}) { // n = 4, memo = { 3: 2, 4: 3 } if (n in memo) return memo[n]; // If we already calculated this value, return it if (n === 1 || n === 2) return 1;</p>
<p>// Store the result in the memo first before returning // Make sure to pass the memo in to your calls to fib! memo[n] = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo); return memo[n]; }</p>
<p>// memo[5] = fib(4) + fib(3) = 3 + memo[3] = 5 // memo[4] = fib(3) + fib(2) = 2 + 1 = 3 // memo[3] = fib(2) + fib(1) = 1 + 1 = 2</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li>Apply tabulation to iterative problems to make them less than polynomial time.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Main considerations for using tabulation:
<ul>
<li>Figure out how big is your table
<ul>
<li>Typically going to be base on input size (number in fibonacci, length of string in wordBreak)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What does my table represent?
<ul>
<li>You are generally building up your answer.</li>
<li>In fibonacci, we used the table to store the fib number at the corresponding index.</li>
<li>In stepper, we stored the boolean of whether it was possible to get to that location.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What initial values do I need to seed?
<ul>
<li>Consider what your end result should be (boolean, number, etc.).</li>
<li>Your seed data is generally going to be the immediate answer that we know from our base condition.</li>
<li>In fibonacci, we knew the first two numbers of the series.</li>
<li>In stepper, we knew that it was possible to get to our starting location, so we seeded it as true, defaulting the rest to false so that we could later change its value if we could make that step.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do I iterate and fill out my table?
<ul>
<li>We typically need to iterate over or up to our input in some way in order to update and build up our table until we get our final result.</li>
<li>In fibonacci, we iterated up to our input number in order to calculate the fib number at each step.</li>
<li>In stepper, we iterated over each possible stepping location. If we could have made it to that point from our previous steps (ie that index was true in our table), we continued updating our table by marking the possible landing spots as true.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Example of a tabulated fibonacci:</p>
<p>// Using tabulation // Time Complexity: O(n) // - We are iterating through an array directly related to the size of the input and performing a constant number of calculations at each step (adding our two previous values together and storing the result in the array). function fib(n) { // We create a table to track our values as we build them up // We’re making it n+1 here so that table[n] lines up with the nth fib number // This is because arrays are zero-indexed. // We could have used an array of length n, but we would have to remember that // the nth fib number would then be stored at table[n-1]. Completely doable, // but I think making them line up is more intuitive. let table = new Array(n + 1); // Seed our table with our starting values. // Again, if we had a table of length n, we could have seeded table[0] = 1 // and table[1] = 1 and had the same final result with our indices shifted. table[0] = 0; table[1] = 1;</p>
<p>// Iterate through our input and fill out our table as we go. for (let i = 2; i &lt; table.length; i++) { table[i] = table[i - 1] + table[i - 2]; }</p>
<p>// At the end, the final entry in our table is the result we are looking for. // The table holds all of the sub-answers that we used to get to this result. return table[n]; }</p></li>

</ol>
<ul>
<li>Time Complexity: Average O(n log n), Worst O(n^2)
<ul>
<li>In our worst case, the pivot that we select results in every element going into either the left or right array. If this happens we end up making n recursive calls to quickSort, with n comparisons at each call.</li>
<li>In our average case, we pick something that more evenly splits the arrays, resulting in approximately log n recursive calls and an overall complexity of O(n log n).</li>
<li>Quick sort is unique in that the worst case is so exceedingly rare that it is often considered an O(n log n) complexity, even though this is not technically accurate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Space Complexity: Our implementation O(n), Possible implementation O(log n)
<ul>
<li>The partition arrays that we create are directly proportional to the size of the input, resulting in O(n) space complexity.</li>

<h2 id="lists-stacks-and-queues">Lists, Stacks, and Queues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do the projects over and see make sure to know the following</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Explain and implement a Linked List.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A linked list are a collection of ordered data that track three main components:
<ul>
<li>head: beginning of the list</li>
<li>tail: end of the list</li>
<li>length: count of the number of elements in the list</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The main differences between lists and arrays are that a list does not have random access or indices to signify where in the list an element is.
<ul>
<li>The only references to elements that we have in a list are the head and the tail.</li>
<li>If we want an element in the middle of the list, we would have to traverse the list until we encountered it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The two main types of linked lists that we talked about are Singly Linked Lists and Doubly Linked Lists.
<ul>
<li>Singly Linked Lists are composed of nodes that only have a reference to the next node in the list. We can only traverse the list in one direction.</li>
<li>Doubly Linked Lists are composed of nodes that have a reference to both the next node and the previous node in the list. This allows us to traverse both forwards and backwards.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Methods of a linked list that we should know are:
<ul>
<li>addToTail: Adds a new node to the end of the list.</li>
<li>addToHead: Adds a new node to the front of the list.</li>
<li>insertAt: Adds a new node at the specified position (we need to traverse to that point, then update pointers)</li>
<li>removeTail: Removes the last node of the list.</li>
<li>removeHead: Removes the first node of the list.</li>
<li>removeFrom: Removes the node at the specified position.</li>
<li>contains: Traverses the list and returns a boolean to indicate if the value was found at any node.</li>
<li>get: Returns a reference to the node at the specified position.</li>
<li>set: Updates the value of the node at the specified position.</li>
<li>size: Returns the current length of the list.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Time complexities for these methods:
<ul>
<li>Accessing a node: O(n), because we may have to traverse the entire list.</li>
<li>Searching a list: O(n), because we may have to traverse the entire list.</li>
<li>Inserting a value: O(1), under the assumption that we have a reference to the node that we want to insert it after/before. If we don’t have this reference we would first have to access it (O(n) from above), but the actual creation is O(1)</li>
<li>Deleting a node: O(1), for the same reasons as insertion. If we first need to find the previous and next nodes, we would need to access them (O(n) from above), but the actual deletion is O(1)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Be able to implement a Singly Linked List and a Doubly Linked List. This would require you to use a Node class with a value instance variable and an instance variable that points to the next (and possibly previous) Node instance(s). You should then be able to interact with these Nodes to perform all of the actions of a Linked List, as we defined above.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Explain and implement a Stack.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A Last In First Out (LIFO) Abstract Data Type (ADT).
<ul>
<li>LIFO: The last element put into the stack is the first thing removed from it. Think of it as a can of Pringles or a pile of dishes.</li>
<li>ADT: The actual implementation of the stack can vary as long as the main principles and methods associated with them are abided by. We could use Nodes like we did with Linked Lists, we could use an Array as an underlying instance variable as long as the methods we implement only interact with it in the way a stack should be interacted with, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Methods of a Stack we should know are:
<ul>
<li>push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.</li>
<li>pop: Removes an element from the top of the stack.</li>
<li>peek: Returns the value of the top element of the stack.</li>
<li>size: Returns the number of elements in the stack.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Time Complexities:
<ul>
<li>Adding an element: O(1), since we are always adding it to the top and the addition doesn’t affect any other elements.</li>
<li>Removing an element: O(1), we’re always taking the top element of the stack.</li>
<li>Finding or Accessing a particular element: O(n), since we can only interact with our stack by removing elements from the top, we may have to remove every element to find what we’re looking for.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Explain and implement a Queue.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A First In First Out (FIFO OR LILO) Abstract Data Type (ADT).
<ul>
<li>FIFO: The first element put into the queue is the first thing removed from it. Think of it as if you are waiting in line at a store, first come, first serve.</li>
<li>ADT: The actual implementation of the queue can vary as long as the main principles and methods associated with them are abided by. We could use Nodes like we did with Linked Lists, we could use an Array as an underlying instance variable as long as the methods we implement only interact with it in the way a queue should be interacted with, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Methods of a Queue we should know are:
<ul>
<li>enqueue: Adds an element to the back of the queue.</li>
<li>dequeue: Removes an element from the front of the queue.</li>
<li>peek: Returns the value of the front element of the queue.</li>
<li>size: Returns the number of elements in the queue.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Time Complexities:
<ul>
<li>Adding an element: O(1), since we are always adding it to the back. If we are using Nodes instead of a simple array, keeping a reference to the last node allows us to immediately update these pointers without having to do any traversal.</li>
<li>Removing an element: O(1), we’re always taking the front element of the queue.</li>
<li>Finding or Accessing a particular element: O(n), since we can only interact with our queue by removing elements from the front, we may have to remove every element to find what we’re looking for.</li>
</ul></li>
