<h2 id="assessment-structure">Assessment Structure</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 hours, 55 minutes</li>
<li>Mixture of multiple choice (5-10), free response (1-3) and VSCode problems (40ish specs).
<ul>
<li>Free response just requires enough detail to answer the question, 1-3 sentences. As long as you are able to explain the concept and answer all aspects that it asks, you are good.</li>
<li>Coding problems come in two varieties:
<ul>
<li>Writing raw SQL like the projects from Tuesday to create tables, insert values, query for records, join tables for queries, etc.</li>
<li>Using sequelize to perform actions such as creating migrations, models, seeders, and then interacting with those models to query for, create, modify, delete, etc.</li>
<li>Both of these sections have their own practice assessment</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Standard assessment procedures
<ul>
<li>You will be in an individual breakout room</li>
<li>Use a single monitor and share your screen</li>
<li>Only have open those resources needed to complete the assessment:
<ul>
<li>Zoom</li>
<li>VSCode</li>
<li>Browser with AAO and Progress Tracker (to ask questions)</li>

<h3 id="portfolio-quality-not-directly-assessed">Portfolio Quality (Not directly assessed)</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Recall the items recruiters are most interested in</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Professionalism and good design (described below)</li>
<li>Would you be able to tell that this wasn’t done by a professional dev?</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Explain aspects of a good looking Web application</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Padding and Margin
<ul>
<li>Padding on every element allows for content that does not butt up against edges</li>
<li>Margins on every element allow for elements that do not butt up against each other</li>
<li>Balance your whitespace: be consistent and even across your page</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use a color palette to ensure a consistent theme and avoid clashes.
<ul>
<li>You’ll typicaly want a main and secondary color with an accent color or two used sparingly</li>
<li>There are many sites and applications that can help you in choosing these colors, use those resources if you aren’t as confident in this design aspect! (I like https://coolors.co/ personally!)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use fonts that pair well
<ul>
<li>In general, if using multiple fonts, try to keep it to two that pair well. More fonts can look inconsistent and messy.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts page</a> has a section for common pairings which can be helpful to see what other developers and designers have commonly used together.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use font size, weight, and spacing to make your page easy for your user to parse
<ul>
<li>Large, bold headers, smaller subheaders, and smaller bodies allow the user to easily scan your pages and pick up the highlights.</li>
<li>With these variances, still try to be consistent. Having ten different font sizes is generally more confusing for a user than having just two or three.</li>
<li>Breaking up large blocks into multiple smaller lines/sections is easier for a user to digest.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Accessibility should be a goal for any application’s design. One easy check is to see if your color choices pass accessibility <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">contrast requirements</a>, allowing users with a variety of visual disabilities to enjoy your product.</li>
<li>Use modern styles and CSS features. These can include things like:
<ul>
<li>Rounding the corners of buttons and modals</li>
<li>Applying CSS transitions when elements appear on or disappear from the page</li>
<li>Using shadows to make elements stand out</li>
<li>Making sure page elements feel interactive, such as changing background colors or cursors on hover</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Identify App Academy’s expectations of your projects for after you graduate</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>There are some core features that should be part of each of your projects that you use in your portfolio.</li>
<li>These features allow for recruiters to easily navigate your site and provide a base level of functionality and professionalism.
<ul>
<li>Have plenty of seed data. Make your project look as though it is an actively used application. The barebones functionality is not as impressive if someone looking at it cannot imagine what it would actually look like in practice.</li>
<li>Have a favicon. The little icon in your browser’s tab is an easy way to show your attention to detail and make your page stand out.</li>
<li>Provide a demo login. Recruiters generally will not want to have to use their own credentials to create an account on your site. A button to simulate a demo user logging in is an easy way for them to see the application and gives you an opportunity to seed your site with more content for the user to interact with.</li>
<li>Remove any console output. Logging the internal state of the application may be helpful during your development, but when it is time to showcase your work a clean console free of logs and error messages is a sign of professionalism.</li>
<li>Include personal links. The intent of these projects is for recruiters and other developers to see them, be impressed, and want to have you join their team. Include your personal links such as GitHub, LinkedIn, a personal portfolio site, etc., so that they can take the next step and connect with you!</li>
<li>Include a scorecard! We’ll get more into the specifics of this process as we start producing projects, but scorecards are a way for App Academy to be able to provide you feedback on your projects. It’s an easy format for you to be able to see ways that you could improve the project and for instructors and career coaches to be able to provide that feedback. This will only be seen by you and the a/A team, but it’ll help you get your project in its most presentable form!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Practice good code hygiene when making projects live</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Making your application as polished as possible means developers (and potential future coworkers) will want to take a look at how you got it working. This means we should try to make our code as presentable as our actual applications!</li>
<li>Use comments! Describe what you are actually implementing. Explain what a function does. If a particularly tricky bit of logic is being used, explain what is actually happening. A concise explanation can make complicated code easy to understand.</li>
<li>Use standard naming conventions. A descriptive variable name in an identifiable convention can be extremely helpful in reading code.</li>
<li>Indent your code! Opening up a new block of code should result in an indent.</li>
<li>Break up large chunks of code into smaller functions. Remember that your functions should be performing single tasks. Can you create a couple of helper functions so that your code makes more sense?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rdbms-and-database-entities">RDBMS and Database Entities</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Define what a relational database management system is</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System</li>
<li>A software application that you run that your programs can connect to so that they can store, modify, and retrieve data.</li>
<li>An RDBMS can track many databases. We will use PostgreSQL, or “postgres”, primarily for our RDBMS and it will be able to create individual databases for each of our projects.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Describe what relational data is</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>In general, relational data is information that is connected to other pieces of information.</li>
<li>When working with relational databases, we can connect two entries together utilizing foreign keys (explained below).</li>
<li>In a pets database, we could be keeping track of dogs and cats as well as the toys that each of them own. That “ownership” of a cat to a toy is the “relational” aspect of relational data. Two pieces of information that can be connected together to show some sort of meaning.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Define what a database is</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The actual location that data is stored.</li>
<li>A database can be made up of many tables that each store specific kinds of information.</li>
<li>We could have a pets database that stores information about many different types of animals. Each animal type could potentially be represented by a different table.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Define what a database table is</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Within a database, a table stores one specific kind of information.</li>
<li>The records (entries) on these tables can be connected to records on other tables through the use of foreign keys</li>
<li>In our pets database, we could have a <code>dogs</code> table, with individual records</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Describe the purpose of a primary key</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A primary key is used in the database as a unique identifier for the table.</li>
<li>We often use an “id” field that simply increments with each entry. The incrementing ensures that each record has a unique identifier, even if their are other fields of the record that are repeated (two people with the same name would still need to have a unique identifier, for example).</li>
<li>With a unique identifier, we can easily connect records within the table to records from other tables.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Describe the purpose of a foreign key</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A foreign key is used as the connector from this record to the primary key of another table’s record.</li>
<li>In our pets example, we can imagine two tables to demonstrate: a table to represent cats and a table to represent toys. Each of these tables has a primary key of “id” that is used as the unique identifier. In order to make a connection between a toy and a cat, we can add another field to the cat table called “owner_id”, indicating that it is a foreign key for the cat table. By setting a toy’s “owner_id” to the same value as a particular cat’s “id”, we can indicate that the cat is the owner of that toy.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Describe how to properly name things in PostgreSQL</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Names within postgres should generally consist of only lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores.</li>
<li>Tables within a database are plural by convention, so a table for cats would typically be “cats” and office locations would be “office_locations” (all lowercase, underscores to replace spaces, plural)</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Connect to an instance of PostgreSQL with the command line tool psql</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The <code>psql</code> command by default will try to connect to a database and username that matches your system’s username</li>
<li>We connect to a different database by providing an argument to the psql command
<ul>
<li><code>psql pets</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>To connect with a different username we can use the <code>-U</code> flag followed by the username we would like to use. To connect to the <code>pets</code> database as <code>pets_user</code>
<ul>
<li><code>psql -U pets_user pets</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If there is a password for the user, we can tell psql that we would like a prompt for the password to show up by using the <code>-W</code> flag.
<ul>
<li><code>psql -U pets_user -W pets</code> (the order of our flags doesn’t matter, as long as any arguments associated with them are together, such as <code>pets_user</code> directly following <code>-U</code> in this example)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Identify whether a user is a normal user or a superuser by the prompt in the psql shell</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You can tell if you are logged in as a superuser or normal user by the prompt in the terminal.</li>
<li>If the prompt shows <code>=&gt;</code>, the user is a normal user</li>
<li>If the prompt show <code>=#</code>, the user is a superuser</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a user for the relational database management system</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Within psql, we can create a user with the <code>CREATE USER {username} {WITH options}</code> command.</li>
<li>The most common options we’ll want to use are <code>WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword'</code> to provide a password for the user we are creating, <code>CREATEDB</code> to allow the user to create new databases, or <code>SUPERUSER</code> to create a user with all elevated permissions.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a database in the database management system</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>We can use the command <code>CREATE DATABASE {database name} {options}</code> inside psql to create a new database.</li>
<li>A popular option we may utilize is <code>WITH OWNER {owner name}</code> to set another user as the owner of the database we are making.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Configure a database so that only the owner (and superusers) can connect to it</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>We can <code>GRANT</code> and <code>REVOKE</code> privileges from a database to users or categories of users.</li>
<li>In order to remove connection privileges to a database from the public we can use <code>REVOKE CONNECT ON DATABASE {db_name} FROM PUBLIC;</code>, removing all public connection access.</li>
<li>If we wanted to grant it back, or to a specific user, we could similarly do <code>GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE {db_name} FROM {specific user, PUBLIC, etc.};</code></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>View a list of databases in an installation of PostgreSQL</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>To list all databases we can use the <code>\l</code> or <code>\list</code> command in psql.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Create tables in a database</p>
<p>CREATE TABLE {table name} ( {columnA} {typeA}, {columnB} {typeB}, etc… );</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The whitespace does not matter. Creating the SQL statements on multiple lines is easier to read, but just like JavaScript, they can be presented differently.</li>
<li>One common issue is that SQL does not like trailing commas, so the last column cannot have a comma after its type in this example.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>View a list of tables in a database</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>To list all database tables, use the <code>\dt</code> command.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Identify and describe the common data types used in PostgreSQL</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>There are many different data types that we can use in our tables, here are some common examples:
<ul>
<li><code>SERIAL</code>: autoincrementing, very useful for IDs</li>
<li><code>VARCHAR(n)</code>: a string with a character limit of <code>n</code></li>
<li><code>TEXT</code>: doesn’t have character limit, but less performant</li>
<li><code>BOOLEAN</code>: true/false</li>
<li><code>SMALLINT</code>: signed two-byte integer (-32768 to 32767)</li>
<li><code>INTEGER</code>: signed four-byte integer (standard)</li>
<li><code>BIGINT</code>: signed eight-byte integer (very large numbers)</li>
<li><code>NUMERIC</code>: or <code>DECIMAL</code>, can store exact decimal values</li>
<li><code>TIMESTAMP</code>: date and time</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Describe the purpose of the UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraints, and create columns in database tables that have them</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>In addition to the data type, we can provide flags for constraints to place on our column data.</li>
<li>The <code>UNIQUE</code> flag indicates that the data for the column must not be repeated.</li>
<li>By default we can create entries in our tables that are missing data from columns. When creating a pet, maybe we don’t provide an age because we don’t know it, for example. If we want to require that the data be present in order to create a new record, we can indicate that column must be <code>NOT NULL</code>.</li>
<li><p>In the example below, we are requiring our pets to have unique names and for them to be present (both UNIQUE and NOT NULL). We have no such constraints on the age column, allowing repetition of ages or their complete absence.</p>
<p>CREATE TABLE pets ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL, age SMALLINT );</p></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a primary key for a table</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>When creating a table we can indicate the primary key by passing in the column name to parentheses like so:</p>
<p>CREATE TABLE people ( id SERIAL, first_name VARCHAR(50), last_name VARCHAR(50), PRIMARY KEY (id) );</p></li>
<li><p>We could have also used the <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> flag on the column definition itself:</p>
<p>CREATE TABLE people ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, first_name VARCHAR(50), last_name VARCHAR(50) );</p></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create foreign key constraints to relate tables</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>In our table definition, we can use the line <code>FOREIGN KEY (foreign_key_stored_in_this_table) REFERENCE {other table} ({other_tables_key_name})</code> to connect two tables.</li>
<li><p>This is probably easier to see in an example:</p>
<p>CREATE TABLE people ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, first_name VARCHAR(50), last_name VARCHAR(50) );</p>
<p>CREATE TABLE pets ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255), age SMALLINT, person_id INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES people (id) );</p></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Explain that SQL is not case sensitive for its keywords but is for its entity names</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Exactly as the LO states, <code>CREATE TABLE</code> and <code>create table</code> are interpreted the same way. Using capitalization is a good convention in order to distinguish your keywords.</li>
<li>The entity names that we use ARE case-sensitive, however. So a table named <code>pets</code> is unique from a table named <code>Pets</code>. In general, we prefer to use all lowercase for our entities to avoid any of this confusion.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sql-w10d2---learning-objectives">SQL (W10D2) - Learning Objectives</h2>
<h3 id="sql">SQL</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>How to use the <code>SELECT ... FROM ...</code> statement to select data from a single table</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Supply the column names in the <code>SELECT</code> clause. If we want all columns, we can also use <code>*</code></li>
<li><p>Supply the table names in the <code>FROM</code> clause</p>
– Selects all columns from the friends table SELECT
<ul>
<li>FROM friends;</li>
</ul>
<p>– Selects the first_name column from the friends table (remember whitespace is ignored) SELECT name FROM friends;</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes we may need to specify what table we are selecting a column from, particulurly if we had joined multiple tables together.</p>
<p>– Notice here we are indicating that we want the “name” field from the “friends” table as well as the “name” field from the “puppies” table. We indicate the table name by table.column – We are also aliasing these fields with the AS keyword so that our returned results have friend_name and puppy_name as field headers SELECT friends.name AS friend_name , puppies.name AS puppy_name FROM friends JOIN puppies ON friends.puppy_id = puppies.id</p></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>How to use the <code>WHERE</code> clause on <code>SELECT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, and <code>DELETE</code> statements to narrow the scope of the command</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The <code>WHERE</code> clause allows us to select or apply actions to records that match specific criteria instead of to a whole table.</li>
<li>We can use <code>WHERE</code> with a couple of different operators when making our comparison
<ul>
<li><code>WHERE {column} = {value}</code> provides an exact comparison</li>
<li><code>WHERE {column} IN ({value1}, {value2}, {value3}, etc.)</code> matches any provided value in the <code>IN</code> statement. We can make this more complex by having a subquery inside of the parentheses, having our column match any values within the returned results.</li>
<li><code>WHERE {column} BETWEEN {value1} AND {value2}</code> can check for matches between two values (numeric ranges)</li>
<li><code>WHERE {column} LIKE {pattern}</code> can check for matches to a string. This is most useful when we use the wildcard <code>%</code>, such as <code>WHERE breed LIKE '%Shepherd'</code>, which will match any breed that ends in “Shepherd”</li>
<li>The <code>NOT</code> operator can also be used for negation in the checks.</li>
<li><p>Mathematical operators can be used when performing calculations or comparisons within a query as well, such as</p>
<p>SELECT name, breed, weight_lbs FROM puppies WHERE weight_lbs &gt; 50;</p>
<p>– OR</p>
<p>SELECT name, breed, age_yrs FROM puppies WHERE age_yrs * 10 = 5;</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>How to use the <code>JOIN</code> keyword to join two (or more) tables together into a single virtual table</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>When we want to get information from a related table or do querying based on related table values, we can join the connected table by comparing the foreign key to where it lines up on the other table:</p>
– Here we are joining the puppies table on to the friends table. We are specifying that the comparison we should make is the foreign key puppy_id on the friends table should line up with the primary key id on the puppies table. SELECT
<ul>
<li>FROM friends JOIN puppies ON friends.puppy_id = puppies.id</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>How to use the <code>INSERT</code> statement to insert data into a table</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>When a table is already created we can then insert records into it using the <code>INSERT INTO</code> keywords.</li>
<li><p>We provide the name of the table that we would like to add records to, followed by the <code>VALUES</code> keyword and each record we are adding. Here’s an example:</p>
<p>– We are providing the table name, then multiple records to insert – The values are listed in the order that they are defined on the table INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (column1_value, colum2_value, column3_value), (column1_value, colum2_value, column3_value), (column1_value, colum2_value, column3_value);</p></li>
<li><p>We can also specify columns when we are inserting data. This makes it clear which fields we are providing data for and allows us to provide them out of order, skip null or default values, etc.</p>
<p>– In this example, we want to use the default value for id since it is autoincremented, so we provide DEFAULT for this field INSERT INTO friends (id, first_name, last_name) VALUES (DEFAULT, ‘Amy’, ‘Pond’);</p>
<p>– Alternatively, we can leave it out completely, since the default value will be used if none is provided INSERT INTO friends (first_name, last_name) VALUES (‘Rose’, ‘Tyler’), (‘Martha’, ‘Jones’), (‘Donna’, ‘Noble’), (‘River’, ‘Song’);</p></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>How to use an <code>UPDATE</code> statement to update data in a table</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The <code>UPDATE</code> keyword can be used to find records and change their values in our database.</li>
<li>We generally follow the pattern of <code>UPDATE {table} SET {column} = {new value} WHERE {match condition};</code>.</li>
<li>Without a condition to narrow our records down, we will update every record in the table, so this is an important thing to double check!</li>
<li><p>We can update multiple fields as well by specifying each column in parentheses and their associated new values: <code>UPDATE {table} SET ({column1}, {column2}) = ({value1}, {value2}) WHERE {match condition};</code></p>
<p>– Updates the pet with id of 4 to change their name and breed UPDATE pets SET (name, breed) = (‘Floofy’, ‘Fluffy Dog Breed’) WHERE id = 4;</p></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>How to use a <code>DELETE</code> statement to remove data from a table</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Similar to selecting records, we can delete records from a table by specifying what table we are deleting from and what criteria we would like to match in order to delete.</li>
<li>We follow the general structure <code>DELETE FROM {table} WHERE {condition};</code></li>
<li><p>The condition here is also very important! Without a condition, all records match and will be deleted.</p>
<p>– Deletes from the pets table any record that either has a name Floofy, a name Doggo, or an id of 3. DELETE FROM pets WHERE name IN (‘Floofy’, ‘Doggo’) OR id = 3;</p></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>How to use a seed file to populate data in a database</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Seed files are a great way for us to create records that we want to start our database out with.</li>
<li>Instead of having to individually add records to our tables or manually entering them in psql or postbird, we can create a file that has all of these records and then just pass this file to psql to run.</li>
<li>Seed files are also great if we ever need to reset our database. We can clear out any records that we have by dropping all of our tables, then just run our seed files to get it into a predetermined starting point. This is great for our personal projects, testing environments, starting values for new tables we create, etc.</li>
<li>There are two main ways we can use a seed file with psql, the <code>&lt;</code> and the <code>|</code> operators. They perform the same function for us, just in slightly different orders, taking the content of a .sql file and executing in within the psql environment:
<ul>
<li><code>psql -d {database} &lt; {sql filepath}</code></li>
<li><code>cat {sql filepath} | psql -d {database}</code></li>
</ul></li>

<li>How to perform relational database design</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Steps to Designing the Database:
<ul>
<li>Define the entities. What data are are you storing, what are the fields for each entity?
<ul>
<li>You can think of this in similar ways to OOP (object oriented programming).</li>
<li>If you wanted to model this information using classes, what classes would you make? Those are generally going to be the tables that are created in your database.</li>
<li>The attributes of your classes are generally going to be the fields/columns that we need for each table.</li>

<li>Identify primary keys. Most of the time these will be ids that you can generate as a serial field, incrementing with each addition to the database.</li>
<li>Establish table relationships. Connect related data together with foreign keys. Know how we store these keys in a one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationship.
<ul>
<li>With a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship, we are able to use a foreign key on the table to indicate the other specific record that it is connected to.</li>
<li>With a many-to-many relationship, each record could be connected to multiple records, so we have to create a join table to connect these entities. A record on this join table connects a record from one table to a record from another table. <img src="./oto-relationship.svg" alt="one-to-one" /> <img src="./otm-and-mtm-relationships.svg" alt="one-to-many many-to-many" /></li>

<li>How to use transactions to group multiple SQL commands into one succeed or fail operation</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>We can define an explicit transaction using <code>BEGIN</code> and ending with either <code>COMMIT</code> or <code>ROLLBACK</code>.</li>
<li><p>If any command inside the block fails, everything will be rolled back. We can also specify that we want to roll back at the end of the block instead of committing. We saw that this can be useful when analyzing operations that would manipulate our database.</p>
<p>BEGIN; UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00 WHERE name = ‘Alice’; UPDATE branches SET balance = balance - 100.00 WHERE name = (SELECT branch_name FROM accounts WHERE name = ‘Alice’); UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00 WHERE name = ‘Bob’; UPDATE branches SET balance = balance + 100.00 WHERE name = (SELECT branch_name FROM accounts WHERE name = ‘Bob’); COMMIT;</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>How to apply indexes to tables to improve performance</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>An index can help optimize queries that we have to run regularly. If we are constantly looking up records in a table by a particular field (such as username or phone number), we can add an index in order to speed up this process.</li>
<li>An index maintains a sorted version of the field with a reference to the record that it points to in the table (via primary key). If we want to find a record based on a field that we have an index for, we can look through this index in a more efficient manner than having to scan through the entire table (generally O(log n) since the index is sorted, instead of O(n) for a sequential scan).</li>
<li><p>To add an index to a field we can use the following syntax:</p>
<p>CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);</p></li>
<li><p>To drop an index we can do the following:</p>
<p>DROP INDEX index_name</p></li>
<li>Making an index is not always the best approach. Indices allow for faster lookup, but slow down record insertion and the updating of associated fields, since we not only have to add the information to the table, but also manipulate the index.
<ul>
<li>We generally wouldn’t care about adding an index if:
<ul>
<li>The tables are small</li>
<li>We are updating the table frequently, especially the associated columns</li>
<li>The column has many NULL values</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<ol type="1">
<li>Explain what and why someone would use EXPLAIN</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>EXPLAIN gives us information about how a query will run (the query plan)</li>
<li>It gives us an idea of how our database will search for data as well as a qualitative comparitor for how expensive that operation will be. Comparing the cost of two queries will tell us which one is more efficient (lower cost).</li>
<li>We can also use the ANALYZE command with EXPLAIN, which will actually run the specified query. Doing so gives us more detailed information, such as the milliseconds it took our query to execute as well as specifics like the exact number of rows filtered and returned.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li>Demonstrate how to install and use the node-postgres library and its Pool class to query a PostgreSQL-managed database</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>We can add the <code>node-postgres</code> library to our application with <code>npm install pg</code>. From there we will typically use the Pool class associated with this library. That way we can run many SQL queries with one database connection (as opposed to Client, which closes the connection after a query).</p>
<p>const { Pool } = require(‘pg’);</p>
<p>// If we need to specify a username, password, or database, we can do so when we create a Pool instance, otherwise the default values for logging in to psql are used: const pool = new Pool({ username: ‘&lt;<username>&gt;’, password: ‘&lt;<password>&gt;’, database: ‘&lt;<database>&gt;’})</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>query</code> method on the Pool instance will allow us to execute a SQL query on our database. We can pass in a string that represents the query we want to run</p>
<p>const allAirportsSql = <code>SELECT id, city_id, faa_id, name   FROM airports;</code>;</p>
<p>async function selectAllAirports() { const results = await pool.query(allAirportsSql); console.log(results.rows); pool.end(); // invoking end() will close our connection to the database }</p>
<p>selectAllAirports();</p></li>

<li>Explain how to write prepared statements with placeholders for parameters of the form “$1”, “$2”, and so on</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The prepared statement (SQL string that we wrote) can also be made more dynamic by allowing for parameters to be passed in.</li>
<li><p>The Pool instance’s <code>query</code> function allows us to pass a second argument, an array of parameters to be used in the query string. The location of the parameter substitutions are designated with <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, etc., to signify the first, second, etc., arguments.</p>
<p>const airportsByNameSql = <code>SELECT name, faa_id   FROM airports   WHERE UPPER(name) LIKE UPPER($1)</code>;</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>How to install, configure, and use Sequelize, an ORM for JavaScript</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>To start a new project we use our standard npm initialize statement
<ul>
<li><code>npm init -y</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Add in the packages we will need (sequelize, sequelize-cli, and pg)
<ul>
<li><code>npm install sequelize@^5.0.0 sequelize-cli@^5.0.0 pg@^8.0.0</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Initialize sequelize in our project
<ul>
<li><code>npx sequelize-cli init</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create a database user with credentials we will use for the project
<ul>
<li><code>psql</code></li>
<li><code>CREATE USER example_user WITH PASSWORD 'badpassword'</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Here we can also create databases since we are already in postgres
<ul>
<li><code>CREATE DATABASE example_app_development WITH OWNER example_user</code></li>
<li><code>CREATE DATABASE example_app_test WITH OWNER example_user</code></li>
<li><code>CREATE DATABASE example_app_production WITH OWNER example_user</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If we don’t create these databases now, we could also create them after we make our changes to our config file. If we take this approach, we need to make sure our user that we created has the <code>CREATEDB</code> option when we make them, since sequelize will attempt to make the databases with this user. This other approach would look like:
<ul>
<li>In psql: <code>CREATE USER example_user WITH PASSWORD 'badpassword' CREATEDB</code></li>
<li>In terminal: <code>npx sequelize-cli db:create</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Double check that our configuration file matches our username, password, database, dialect, and seederStorage (these will be filled out for you in an assessment scenario):</p>
<p>{ “development”: { “username”: “sequelize_recipe_box_app”, “password”: “HfKfK79k”, “database”: “recipe_box_development”, “host”: “127.0.0.1”, “dialect”: “postgres”, “seederStorage”: “sequelize” }, “test”: { “username”: “sequelize_recipe_box_app”, “password”: “HfKfK79k”, “database”: “recipe_box_test”, “host”: “127.0.0.1”, “dialect”: “postgres”, “seederStorage”: “sequelize” }, “production”: { “username”: “sequelize_recipe_box_app”, “password”: “HfKfK79k”, “database”: “recipe_box_production”, “host”: “127.0.0.1”, “dialect”: “postgres”, “seederStorage”: “sequelize” } }</p></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>How to use database migrations to make your database grow with your application in a source-control enabled way</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><h4 id="migrations">Migrations</h4>
<ul>
<li>In order to make new database tables and sequelize models that reflect them, we want to generate a migration file and model file using <code>model:generate</code>
<ul>
<li><code>npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name Cat --attributes "firstName:string,specialSkill:string"</code></li>
<li>Here we are creating a migration file and a model file for a Cat. We are specifying that we want this table to have fields for firstName and specialSkill. Sequelize will automatically make fields for an id, createdAt, and updatedAt, as well, so we do not need to specify these.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once our migration file is created, we can go in and edit any details that we need to. Most often we will want to add in database constraints such as <code>allowNull: false</code>, adding a uniqueness constraint with <code>unique: true</code>, adding in character limits to fields such as <code>type: Sequelize.STRING(100)</code>, or specifying a foreign key with references to another table <code>references: { model: 'Categories' }</code>.</li>
<li>After we make any necessary changes to our migration file, we need to perform the migration, which will run the SQL commands to actually create the table.
<ul>
<li><code>npx sequelize-cli db:migrate</code></li>
<li>This command runs any migration files that have not been previously run, in the order that they were created (this is why the timestamp in the file name is important)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If we realize that we made a mistake after migrating, we can undo our previous migration, or all of our migrations. After undoing them, we can make any changes necessary to our migration files (They won’t be deleted from the undo, so we don’t need to generate anything! Just make the necessary changes to the files that already exist and save the files.). Running the migrations again will make the tables with the updates reflected.
<ul>
<li><code>npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo</code></li>
<li><code>npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><h4 id="models---validations-and-associations">Models - Validations and Associations</h4>
<ul>
<li>In addition to the migration files, our <code>model:generate</code> command also created a model file for us. This file is what allows sequelize to transform the results of its SQL queries into useful JavaScript objects for us.</li>
<li><p>The model is where we can specify a validation that we want to perform before trying to run a SQL query. If the validation fails, we can respond with a message instead of running the query, which can be an expensive operation that we know won’t work.</p>
<pre><code>// Before we make changes, sequelize generates the type that this field represents
specification: DataTypes.TEXT

// We can replace the generated format with an object to specify not only the type, but the validations that we want to implement. The validations can also take in messages the respond with on failure and arguments.
specification: {
  type: DataTypes.TEXT,
  validate: {
    notEmpty: {
      msg: &#39;The specification cannot be empty&#39;
    },
    len: {
      args: [10, 100]
      msg: &#39;The specifcation must be between 10 and 100 characters&#39;
    }
  }
}</code></pre></li>
<li>Another key part of the model file is setting up our associations. We can use the <code>belongsTo</code>, <code>hasMany</code>, and <code>belongsToMany</code> methods to set up model-level associations. Doing so is what creates the helpful functionality like <code>addOwner</code> that we saw in the pets example, a function that automatically generates the SQL necessary to create a petOwner record and supplies the appropriate petId and ownerId.
<ul>
<li>In a one-to-many association, we need to have a <code>belongsTo</code> association on the “many” side, and a <code>hasMany</code> association on the “one” side:
<ul>
<li><code>Instruction.belongsTo(models.Recipe, { foreignKey: 'recipeId' });</code></li>
<li><code>Recipe.hasMany(models.Instruction, { foreignKey: 'recipeId' });</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In a many-to-many association, we need to have a <code>belongsToMany</code> on each side of the association. We generally specify a columnMapping object to show the association more clearly:</p>
<pre><code>// In our Owner model
// To connect this Owner to a Pet through the PetOwner
const columnMapping = {
  through: &#39;PetOwner&#39;, // joins table
  otherKey: &#39;petId&#39;, // key that connects to other table we have a many association with
  foreignKey: &#39;ownerId&#39; // our foreign key in the joins table
}
Owner.belongsToMany(models.Pet, columnMapping);

// In our Pet model
// To connect this Pet to an Owner through the PetOwner
const columnMapping = {
  through: &#39;PetOwner&#39;, // joins table
  otherKey: &#39;ownerId&#39;, // key that connects to other table we have a many association with
  foreignKey: &#39;petId&#39; // our foreign key in the joins table
}
Pet.belongsToMany(models.Owner, columnMapping);</code></pre></li>

<ul>
<li><h4 id="seed-files">Seed Files</h4>
<ul>
<li>Seed files can be used to populate our database with starter data.
<ul>
<li><code>npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name add-cats</code></li>
<li><code>up</code> indicates what to create when we seed our database, <code>down</code> indicates what to delete if we want to unseed the database.</li>
<li><p>For our up, we use the <code>queryInterface.bulkInsert()</code> method, which takes in the name of the table to seed and an array of objects representing the records we want to create:</p>
<pre><code>up: (queryInterface, Sequelize) =&gt; {
  return queryInterface.bulkInsert(&#39;&lt;&lt;TableName&gt;&gt;&#39;, [
    { field1: value1a, field2: value2a },
    { field1: value1b, field2: value2b },
    { field1: value1c, field2: value2c }
  ]);
}</code></pre></li>
<li><p>For our down, we use the <code>queryInterface.bulkDelete()</code> method, which takes in the name of the table and an object representing our WHERE clause. Unseeding will delete all records from the specified table that match the WHERE clause.</p>
<p>// If we want to specify what to remove: down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) =&gt; { return queryInterface.bulkDelete(‘&lt;<TableName>&gt;’, { field1: [value1a, value1b, value1c] //…etc. }); } // If we want to remove everything from the table: down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) =&gt; { return queryInterface.bulkDelete(‘&lt;<TableName>&gt;’, null, {}); }</p></li>
<li>Running <code>npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all</code> will run all of our seeder files.</li>
<li><code>npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo:all</code> will undo all of our seeding.</li>
<li><p>If we omit the <code>:all</code> we can run specific seed files</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><h4 id="inserting-with-build-and-create">Inserting with Build and Create</h4>
<ul>
<li>In addition to seed files, which we generally use for starter data, we can create new records in our database by using <code>build</code> and <code>save</code>, or the combined <code>create</code>
<ul>
<li><p>Use the .build method of the Cat model to create a new Cat instance in index.js</p>
<p>// Constructs an instance of the JavaScript <code>Cat</code> class. <strong>Does not // save anything to the database yet</strong>. Attributes are passed in as a // POJO. const newCat = Cat.build({ firstName: ‘Markov’, specialSkill: ‘sleeping’, age: 5 });</p>
<p>// This actually creates a new <code>Cats</code> record in the database. We must // wait for this asynchronous operation to succeed. await newCat.save();</p>
<p>// This builds and saves all in one step. If we don’t need to perform any operations on the instance before saving it, this can optimize our code. const newerCat = await Cat.create({ firstName: ‘Whiskers’, specialSkill: ‘sleeping’, age: 2 })</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><h4 id="updating-records">Updating Records</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>When we have a reference to an instance of a model (i.e. after we have queried for it or created it), we can update values by simply reassigning those fields and using the <code>save</code> method</p>
<p>// Get a reference to the cat record that we want to update (here just the cat with primary key of 1) const cat = await Cat.findByPk(1);</p>
<p>// Change cat’s attributes. cat.firstName = “Curie”; cat.specialSkill = “jumping”; cat.age = 123;</p>
<p>// Save the new name to the database. await cat.save();</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><h4 id="deleting-records">Deleting Records</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>When we have a reference to an instance of a model, we can delete that record by using <code>destroy</code></p>
<p>const cat = await Cat.findByPk(1); // Remove the Markov record. await cat.destroy();</p></li>
<li><p>We can also call <code>destroy</code> on the model itself. By passing in an object that specifies a where clause, we can destroy all records that match that query</p>
<p>await Cat.destroy({ where: { specialSkill: ‘jumping’ } });</p></li>
