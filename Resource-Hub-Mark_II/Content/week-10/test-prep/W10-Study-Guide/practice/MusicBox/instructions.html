<h2 id="musicbox-schema-instructions">MusicBox Schema Instructions</h2>
<p>You are in charge of implementing the schema found in database-schema.png. You will implement the database using SQL. After it, you will drop the database and implement it again using Sequelize.</p>
<p>Before you start, create a user called “musicbox_app” with a password and CREATEDB privileges.</p>
<ul>
<li>SQL Practice
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a database called “musicbox” with owner “musicbox_app”</li>
<li>Create the three tables in the schema “Genres”, “Albums” and “Artists”. Ensure that you capture the associations as foreign keys in your tables</li>
<li>Create a sql file with seed data from <code>data-seed.txt</code>. Seed your database.</li>
<li>Write the following queries in SQL</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Find the release date for all the albums by The Beatles.</li>
<li>Find the artist for the album The Life of Pablo.</li>
<li>Find all the albums along with their genres and artists.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sequelize Practice
<ol type="1">
<li>Drop the database called “musicbox”</li>
<li>Use sequelize to initialize a project</li>
<li>Update config/config.json with your “musicbox_app” user and the “musicbox” database</li>
<li>Utilize sequelize_cli model:generate to create the three Models that correspond to every table in the schema. Remember that <code>sequelize model:generate</code> takes the singular model names (“Genre”, “Album” and “Artist”) and will generate a migration file with the pluralized table names (“Genres”, “Albums”, and “Artists”).</li>
<li>Update the migrations files with validations and references</li>
<li>Update the models with the associations in the schema</li>
<li>Utilize sequelize-cli seed:generate to create seed files for each Model, and migrate the data in <code>data-seed.txt</code> into these files.</li>
<li>Create a new file called <code>queries.js</code> in the top level of your application.</li>
<li><p>Require your three models:</p>
<p>const { Album, Genre, Artist } = require(‘./models’);</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>Using the Sequelize query syntax, prepare three functions that will return the values specified in these queries:</p>
<pre><code>- Find the release date for all the albums by The Beatles.
- Find the artist for the album The Life of Pablo.
- Find all the albums along with their genres and artists.</code></pre>
