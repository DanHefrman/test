<h2 id="graphs">Graphs</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Explain and implement a Graph.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A good place to start with explaining a graph is comparing to a tree:
<ul>
<li>A graph can:
<ul>
<li>Consist of any collection of nodes and edges (no limits on connections)</li>
<li>Have cycles</li>
<li>Have disconnected portions (a forest, with multiple trees, for example)</li>
<li>Be missing a root node (don’t have to have one node that connects to everything)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In a tree, we had an idea of children and parents, in a graph we have neighbors (no hierarchy)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Just like how we could represent trees in multiple ways, we can represent graphs many ways as well, with advantages/disadvantages to each:
<ul>
<li>Adjacency Matrix - 2D Array
<ul>
<li>Visually clear what’s going on</li>
<li><p>One axis (outside array) has an entry (inner array) for each node in the graph. If one node is connected to another node in the graph, our entry in the inner array is set to true. Otherwise the entry is false.</p>
<p>let matrix = [ /* A B C D E F <em>/ /</em>A<em>/ [true, true, true, false, true, false], /</em>B<em>/ [false, true, false, false, false, false], /</em>C<em>/ [false, true, true, true, false, false], /</em>D<em>/ [false, false, false, true, false, false], /</em>E<em>/ [true, false, false, false, true, false], /</em>F*/ [false, false, false, false, true, true]];</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Adjacency List - POJO
<ul>
<li>Object where every value in the graph has a key</li>
<li>Value for the key is an array with each other node that it is connected to (neighbors)</li>
<li>Easy to iterate through</li>
<li>Doesn’t take up as much space as an Adjacency Matrix or Node</li>
<li><p>Can refer to the entire graph by referencing the object</p>
<p>let list = { a: [‘b’, ‘c’, ‘e’], b: [], c: [‘b’, ‘d’], d: [], e: [‘a’], f: [‘e’] };</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Nodes
<ul>
<li>Similar to our linked list or tree implementations</li>
<li>Track the value and the neighbors array as instance variables on the node</li>
<li><p>We don’t have a reference to the overall graph with this implementation</p>
<p>class GraphNode { constructor(val) { this.val = val; this.neighbors = []; } }</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Traverse a graph.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>We can use recursion or iteration to traverse each node.</li>
<li>We generally want to keep track of each node that we’ve visited already so that we don’t get trapped in cycles. Easiest way to do this is to keep a Set variable that we update as we traverse to each node.</li>
<li>The projects from W08D03 and their solutions are a great resource here.
<ul>
<li>Be comfortable with taking either an iterative or a recursive approach to traversing a graph, as well as being able to work with either an adjacency list (like in the friendsOf problem) or a node class (like in the breadthFirstSearch or maxValue problems).</li>
<li>Practice taking the implementation that you did in the project and converting it to a different implementation. You probably used recursion for friendsOf, so try using iteration with a stack array, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>THE INTENTION OF ALL OF THESE CODE BLOCKS IS NOT TO MEMORIZE THEM! You should be comfortable with reasoning out why we are implementing them differently.
<ul>
<li>The main difference between a node implementation and an adjacency list is that we are accessing the node’s <code>neighbors</code> attribute just like we are accessing the values on the list (ie, with an adjacency list saved to a <code>graph</code> variable, <code>graph[node]</code> gives all of <code>node</code>’s neighbors).</li>
<li>The main difference between a depth-first and breadth-first is utilizing a stack vs a queue.</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some possible example implementations:</li>
<li><p>Using a node implementation with recursion:</p>
<p>// If you are unfamiliar, a Set is a data structure that does not allow for repeated values // It makes sense to use here because it has constant lookup time with its <code>has</code> method // and our visited nodes should never have repeats. // We could have accomplished the same thing with a different data structure // (object, array, etc.), but a Set makes sense with what we are tracking. function depthFirstRecur(node, visited=new Set()) { // if this node has already been visited, then return early if (visited.has(node.val)) return;</p>
<pre><code>// otherwise it hasn&#39;t yet been visited,
// so print it&#39;s val and mark it as visited.
console.log(node.val);
visited.add(node.val);

// then explore each of its neighbors
node.neighbors.forEach(neighbor =&gt; {
    depthFirstRecur(neighbor, visited);
});</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>depthFirstRecur(f);</p></li>
<li><p>Using a node implementation with iteration:</p>
<p>// This is easy to swap to a breadth-first approach by using a queue instead of a stack! // Instead of popping from the top, we can shift from the front function depthFirstIter(node) { let visited = new Set(); let stack = [ node ];</p>
<pre><code>while (stack.length) {
    let node = stack.pop();

    // if this node has already been visited, then skip this node
    if (visited.has(node.val)) continue;

    // otherwise it hasn&#39;t yet been visited,
    // so print it&#39;s val and mark it as visited.
    console.log(node.val);
    visited.add(node.val);

    // then add its neighbors to the stack to be explored
    stack.push(...node.neighbors);
}</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>depthFirstIter(f);</p></li>
<li>Using an adjacency list with recursion:
<ul>
<li>One advantage of an adjacency list is that, since we have a reference to the whole graph, we can access nodes that aren’t connected to our starting point. This may or may not be desired, so we can implement our functions differently to account for this feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>function depthFirst(graph) { let visited = new Set();</p>
<pre><code>// This loop allows us to access every node/vertex, even if it wasn&#39;t connected
// to where we started.
// If we only wanted to reach points from a starting location, we could take in
// that value as an argument and use it as the node directly with our helper
// function, no need to loop.
for (let node in graph) {
    _depthFirstRecur(node, graph, visited);
}</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>function _depthFirstRecur(node, graph, visited) { if (visited.has(node)) return;</p>
<pre><code>console.log(node);
visited.add(node);

graph[node].forEach(neighbor =&gt; {
    _depthFirstRecur(neighbor, graph, visited);
});</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>depthFirst(graph);</p></li>
<li><p>Using an adjacency list with iteration:</p>
<p>// With starting node, not exploring all nodes, only the connected ones function depthFirstIter(graph, startNode) { // Just like our node implementation, if we want to operate breadth-first, we // can utilize a queue instead of a stack, shifting instead of popping let stack = [startNode]; let visited = new Set();</p>
<p>while (stack.length &gt; 0) { let node = stack.pop(); if (visited.has(node)) continue; console.log(node) visited.add(node); stack.push(…graph[node]); } }</p>
<p>// Exploring all nodes, even unconnected ones. function depthFirstIter(graph) { let visited = new Set();</p>
<p>// Just like with recursion, this loop allows us to access every node/vertex, // even if it wasn’t connected to where we started. // If we only wanted to reach points from a starting location, we could take in // that value as an argument and use it as the startNode directly in our // stack/queue (the implementation we have above). for (let startNode in graph) { let stack = [startNode]; while (stack.length &gt; 0) { let node = stack.pop(); if (visited.has(node)) continue; console.log(node) visited.add(node); stack.push(…graph[node]); } } }</p></li>
<li>With all of thes implementations, we should be able to make conclusions from these traversals as well instead of just console logging.
<ul>
<li>Is it possible to get from node A to node B?
<ul>
<li>Here we’re really implementing a search, like the breadthFirstSearch problem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is the maximum/minimum value we can encounter if we start at node X?
<ul>
<li>Instead of returning a boolean, we want to compare values of nodes and return the appropriate value
<ul>
<li>If we do this recursively we can compare this node and to each of its neighbors values and return the maximum up the call stack.</li>
<li>If we do this iteratively, we can keep a currentMax variable as we traverse and update it if we find a new max value.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
