<h2 id="assessment-structure">Assessment Structure</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 hour, 40 minutes</li>
<li>Mixture of multiple choice (15-20), free response (1-3) and VSCode (1-3) problems, each with multiple specs.
<ul>
<li>Free response just requires enough detail to answer the question, 1-3 sentences. As long as you are able to explain the concept and answer all aspects that it asks, you are good.</li>
<li>Coding problems will have specs to run (<code>npm test</code>) and check your work against</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Standard assessment procedures
<ul>
<li>You will be in an individual breakout room</li>
<li>Use a single monitor and share your screen</li>
<li>Only have open those resources needed to complete the assessment:
<ul>
<li>Zoom</li>
<li>VSCode</li>
<li>Browser with AAO and Progress Tracker (to ask questions)</li>
<li>Approved Resources for this assessment:</li>
<li>MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 id="binary-trees">Binary Trees</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Explain and implement a Binary Tree.</li>
<li>Identify the three types of tree traversals: pre-order, in-order, and post-order.</li>
<li>Explain and implement a Binary Search Tree.</li>
</ol>
<p>Problems to consider: 1. What are the requisite attributes of a Tree Node? Implement a Tree Node here:</p>
<pre><code>class TreeNode = {
  constructor(val) {
    // Tree Node Attributes Here
  }
}</code></pre>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What logic is necessary to insert a node into a binary search tree? implement it here:</p>
<p>class BST { constructor() { this.root = null; }</p>

<li><p>Given a tree, be able to determine the order of each traversal type: <img src="./public/number-tree.png" alt="Number tree" /></p></li>

<li>Remember there are different ways to implement a Graph. We learned about the Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List, and Node Implementations. What are the differences between these?</li>
<li><p>What are the requisite attributes of a Graph Node? Implement a Graph Node here:</p>
<p>class GraphNode { constructor(val){ // your code here } }</p></li>

<p>write a function that traverses this list from one name to another name (pick 2) and returns a list of the names it passes along the way using BFS and DFS:</p>
